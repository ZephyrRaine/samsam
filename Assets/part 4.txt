and I'm off again this is the last stretch now so thank goodness I can't remember exactly how to get out of here oh ok I have to go this way I'm estimating around an hour more it'll take which isn't too bad as long as I don't get lost which is quite possible this is the only part of the journey I'm not convinced I know the way about so we’ll see how that goes um I've restarted Music for 18 Musicians because I want another reliable timekeeping piece of music that I know relatively well the roads now are quite uh it’s still very empty around here and um no no no I'm not going North oh my god what do I do oh I see ok going South yeah ok I'm waiting at a red light I can see a Toys R Us behind some bushes I expect it’s closed down now and empty if they've had a clearance sale stuff and stuff which I know they did around where I live in Luton the this is a common theme even without me trying is just abandoned worn down old decrepit dusty dirty filled with rubbish old buildings being consumed again by nature and I'm not even trying to get this in here this is just what I'm noticing around and I think that is so amazing and I'm feeling happy about that um and I am feeling happy about this now I've gotten over my initial fear haha A38 ok there’s a sign up there that says Plymouth on it so that’s that’s a good sign that wasn’t an intentional pun so I'm slowly trickling around these corners and these traffic lights with these other cars um around this nightmare roundabout situation I can see all the caravans again I could see earlier I'm following around the same area oh missed the green light I'm gonna have to wait people behind me look annoyed that’s ok though there’s a big flag flapping advertising the caravans behind the pine trees um I'm on the other side of the road from where I was before when I was describing the detail of the ground I can see polystyrene like burger like food takeaway box and some daisies that are about to bloom they’re really very close the tips of their petals are pink like they get when they’re just about to pop and I'm coming off onto the M5 now again going up a short little road onto the main road it’s thick with trees motorway is almost empty as it was before I really don’t know why haha but I'm not complaining there’s a weird feeling of I don't know there’s a weird feeling in the air a feeling of kind of collective sadness or collective angst or anxiety I don't know why I just I feel this about the way all the cars are not the cars around me but like the the people at the service stations there’s something there’s no kind of there’s no camaraderie there’s no feeling of um we’re all in this together or if there is that feeling it’s a feeling of we’re all in this together because we have to be or because something bad is gonna happen there’s there should be more people out and it’s it’s it’s a little unsettling the it’s getting colder it’s 12 degrees sky is the sun is much lower can see the patch of sunlight through the clouds is much lower it’s got an orange tint to it rather than just yellow or white suggesting sunset I think um apart from that the sky is just grey um this road is very dusty and there’s cones with reflective lights on them I'm gonna turn my lights um my side lights on because it’s getting quite dark now there’s just so many leafless trees and then a few dark deep green evergreen trees breaking up the ground but not adding any brightness just enhancing the darkness of the density of the the foliage and stuff there’s a pole uh post over to the right with a a red light on it I don't know what that’s for attached to some kind of building um the road just divided and I'm now on the road towards the A38 I or am I on the A38 now I'm not sure but I'm heading towards Plymouth so I'm I think actually it’s gonna be ok I probably am gonna find my way there’s a field coming up here on the right with white and black sheep um in very light green brown uh grass very sporadic grass it it doesn’t look like grass that sheep should be eating that doesn't look like enough grass at all for them there sides of these the banks are getting a lot steeper and taller and the rocks are brown red brown um mud dirt on the side they look almost like bricks that have been placed by by humans um or at least the humans have helped shape the mounds so that the road can fit nicely in it um I wouldn't be surprised again on the right they're either erosion lines or lines from human interference um there’s a ditch going down to the left now there’s a sign saying that plymouth is 40 miles away so I don't have very long left um there’s a flag to the right there’s buildings behind a red dirt mound on the left and bushes and a steep hill with thin individual sticking up light brown sticks poking out of the ground and a dark green tarp covering up grass and mud on the right from where there must have been a landslide um there’s a haha a small um plaster I think orange elephant um with a massive gash in its head that says ice cream parlour on it supposedly I mean I guess it’s too attract kids but it looks quite horrific to me and very out of out of proportion there’s a petrol station coming up on the left um I'm recognising all of this a lot now we’re definitely getting quite close um like I know how far far away we are but I'm recognising this as um feeling close enough to be noteworthy the road is splitting up ahead again and there’s a sign for a hotel um it looks like an american motel roadside hotel very flat one story um with a big kind of sign outside tall sign and a courtyard area but I've past that now um past that now and I'm going right into this continuing on to the A38 towards Plymouth um it’s curving up and in and around and up this hill um the car is passing me on the right no on the left sorry and oh I'm not going up the hill actually I'm curving round and going deeper into the tree area there’s um an SOS phone sign a quarter of a mile away it says I can actually see the phone phone from here yeah coming up and this bridge looks old but there’s a crack down the centre of it it’s quite frightening but I've just gone underneath it um a sign so dirty and covered in um like mildew that it’s barely legible said Devon Expressway um I guess that’s what I'm driving now there’s some cones that have been tipped up there’s a collapsed sign there’s um fallen trees and big banks with cream light stone and fine dirt there’s the sky is almost completely monochrome black and white now very pale grey um there’s more metal barriers and there’s shipping containers says emergency sign store on it to the left there’s a race course Exeter race course I've never seen that before I don't know why I'm not I feel as though I've missed a few things that I'm used to seeing on the left here is Haldon Forest Diner and it’s a little building that has tempted me so much every time I've driven past it looks like something out of Twin Peaks I just saw a dead badger and it looks it looks very american or like swiss in its design um like a little lodge I imagine there being a kind of greasy buffet inside or like a little not american at all actually very european or rural american not um not american diner but in in just looks really um interesting to me I'm going down now in a more narrow dual carriageway there’s a collapsed fence with red and white tape strewn across theoss across the ground and trees thick on each side and now it’s opening up into a field on the left we’re we’re bending left round the corner now and I can see hills in the distance silhouetted now by the by the fading light and the and the fog turning it into turning the hills into just outlines and shapes and colours um no no detail in them at all and we’re curving round still more um deeper into this into this forest area and there’s a petrol station now on the left with a sign to Chudleigh and a big warehouse with dirt mounds again outside it and poles and wires the sign for steam train trips and boat trips and we’re curving round to the right now coming back round onto another uh onto a wider dual carriageway section with bridges ahead and the opposite direction traffic to the right divided by grass in the middle um that bridged looked to be constructed with kind of stone um stone stuck together not just concrete like the others um it feels as though we’re getting more rural I can see the the contrast in the clouds and the sky is fading even more and there’s a yellow patch from where a grey cloud must be covering the sun nearby and um there’s some gravel to the ri to the left separating the grass from the road se and then the grass leads on to a dirt path which goes up to a hill there’s a sign of a red sign with a no blue sign with a red X on it another concrete bridge overhead a a parking sign lots of houses to the left now um big residential area all the same colour all a kind of pale cream with a dark brown grey roof um all of the houses look like there’s there’s loads of them hundreds um hills and grass much less farm land much more um recreational space it seems like for the houses nearby um the sign ahead is telling me that we’re gonna be curving around again I think I just saw a sewage uh tank to the left down in the ditch there’s a few cars around me but not too many um again a sign is telling me that Plymouth is ahead so that’s that’s good comforting knowledge um stretching out onto a wider road again not going round a curve so much anymore um standard brown hills brown trees everything is darker everything is paler everything is less saturated there’s a taxi behind me with a traditional taxi light on the top of its roof um and it’s just overtaken and slowing down for the car in front there’s a big sheet of plastic on the side of the road there wrapped up around the base of the tree thin tree uh that phone SOS sign is split into half and half is on the floor and half is on the pole there’s a lorry ahead that’s driving slowly I'll have to um overtake it but there’s some cars on my right they’re passing right now I'll go in front that blue car that just passed had a blue monkey hanging in the window haha like stuck stuck with little sticky um suction cup hands to the window there’s a really beautiful chalky blue house to the right there and amongst the other cream and white boring houses um these roads are really curving a lot and I can see now up around this corner a giant kiln a big um ceramic tile factory um towering above the the landscape at the bottom of this hill uh churning steam or smoke into the air I think it’s steam it’s very white blending with the with the clouds above um small stone walls to the right with a pink house behind it um orange flowers to the left uh big metal bridge overhead um further more like more hills and ditches and pylons I'm passing past the british ceramic tile factory now it’s a it’s corrugated metal and just giant and cuboid only one shape and to the left there’s a load of caravans must be for sale to the right a pink house with blue to the left a giant stone gateway with metal gates um and pillars stone pillars there’s a stone top to the to the gateway part um more pylons ahead and another bridge um a metal walking bridge next to a concrete driving bridge um again more pylons down to the left there wires just grazing the top of the the trees um bunching and um hiding what looks like the buildings in the woods I can't can't entirely see Plymouth is 29 miles away now really getting close there’s a little green bin and it’s completely full and there’s a car parked to the side another bin that isn’t as full *cough* there’s a car park on the right and oh there’s Trago on the left um big castle white castle looking building with turrets and um walls around um that is such a weird place just the weirdest place I really wanna go I think that’d be an amazing place to explore I've only heard from what {…} has talked about really but it seems really cool to me there’s a little a little fence here protecting nothing uh maybe pro actually perhaps protecting a little square ditch I'm not sure all of the landscapes really are so similar they're there’s not much to differentiate between this landscape and the other landscapes I've been driving um really weird um there’s a car in front a red car with a some kind of fabric or lino wrapped up and tied to the roof tied to the ladder um a couple driving it I don't know if they're I don't know and a little  van in front another half of a phone sign again with the top half has fallen off it must be a problem with the design I can see a church tower ahead um behind trees more caravans and a wooden uh slatted house white white wood painted slatted house on the left a yellow truck with weird blue um kind of some kind of blue lighting design on the inside of the cabin and a really tall hill coming up in front of me um I can see where the sun is now it’s really covered up behind clouds and there's just the faintest uh patch of light where it must be um down to the left are more houses I can see with lots of skylights and old kind of traditional wood walls it seems um I'm going up a hill now uh the centre parting separating the two roads um has white flowers in it again uh looking again like little patches of snow or frost or dew and on the other side there’s bigger white flowers fully fully bloomed and and in the ce bigger bigger flowers again in the centre that have come out a pink house connected to a green house connected to a cream house on the right creamy yellow uh a sign for a garage mead garage which is very fantasy again I love that kind of thing and a formation of birds flying over head and a corrugated roof to the left and more signs to the left pointing to a caravan parks there was a rust a rusting gate uh between two hedges couldn't see at all where it was leading and perhaps perhaps a farm house there was some dark brown sheep just there so and some farm vehicles so I think probably it was a farm house but it looked like it hadn’t been opened in years or something sign up ahead says Two Bridges Princetown um going down a hill now it’s in areas becoming more hilly and to the right there's just hundreds and hundreds of houses all packed together behind the trees now can’t see them anymore bridge overhead lorries to the left um behind a metal barred f fence some kind of industrial area um some lorry storage area or something there I don't guess know I'm not sure sign up ahead saying motel services um car just slipped there as I went over that hill I don't know quite sure what happened roads curving again round to the right and still not many cars a very small orange car in front that convertible with the roof down black car that’s just passed in front the guy’s hair if blowing in the breeze as he’s driving and the orange car has just passed on the left it’s completely fogged up on the windows condensation must not have a good air system inside looks very old um in front there’s a a big lorry with a tank of something on the back um possibly cement mixer but it’s not rolling so I'm not sure looks like we’re coming up to Buckfastleigh uh and Totnes is on the sign and Dartmouth um hopefully not driving on the road that the hairy hands are from um I did my project when I applied to do illustration at Plymouth I did small project about the hairy hands um that I worked on that they never actually looked at because I had other work it’s a cool story about hands that um need spectral hairy hands that appear and careen cars off course and make them crash there’s a spire of a church um at the top of that hill surrounded by trees just there there’s flickering lights coming from behind there just come through my back window I don't know what that was about that was weird there's no cars around so it’s quite spooky there’s a purple house and a pink house and all these other houses on this hill here Plymouth is 22 miles now according to the sign I'm really looking forward to being able to not talk and to be able to listen to people when I get when I finish this um I feel like the final stretch now how many times can you talk about fucking trees hills and fields for fucks sake I've j there's its just so repetitive there’s just more and more and more again and again and lamp posts and fences and barriers and diggers and buses there’s a load of coaches and shipping containers down to the left why is it all the same collection of things just in different frequencies there’s a green house with a conservatory and a sign going down there but I don’t it’s all the same objects again and again just in different quantities and different variations and combinations again and again they're in yeah sure there is something interesting in that but im bored out of my mind oh there's a beautiful tree just there with loads of blossom all over it pale pink white blossom on that tree really nice now dirt uh mounds of dirt and a stone wall and warehouses and empty road on the right and fences and a sheet of plastic wrapped around a bush and more fences and another phone sign more hills very um plain hills these ones are not much detail on them at all just one solid green block um curving around the horizon up and down uh ridgebacks y’know like dolphin motion uh church with a english flapping and a bridge I wonder if anyone goes to that church it’s quite in the middle of nowhere it looks well used though there’s there’s houses around here I don't know and two houses shielded by hedges and gates that I can't have a look into uh I need to be careful I keep drifting big car just overtook me need to go down a gear I'm going up the hill um a sign that might’ve said something once that’s been painted over white so it’s just a shape a flat shape on a stick there’s some sheep silhouetted perfectly on top of a hill and as I'm driving past they're kind of rotating and parallaxing around like a like a spinning record or a music box or a roundabout and they're all standing completely still like little constellations speckled on the the top of the hill I've seen from one dimension and they've they've passed now and the landscape is just one colour it’s just brown it’s just brown and green and yellow not much yellow browny yellow dirty dirty brown colour going down a hill um all the way quite a steep hill going all the way down there’s a little farm house barn building with a a door lopsided that’s like fallen off its hinges um sign coming up ahead for Plymouth again uh Plymouth up ahead there’s a pylon um being slowly revealed by this bridge as I come closer and headlights flickering between um fence posts and endless stretches of road still 17 miles Plymouth is now 17 miles to go 17 miles 17 miles not long caravans on the left again not long to go um more little flowers um blooming up between the rubbish at the side of the road here and more animals sheep oh shit I drifted all the way into the middle of the road I'm back now uh horses horses now on a the side of a very steep hill um mountain horses a white one with big fluffy flares on its legs flared feet flared legs flarey horse yeah coming up and down down a hill again there’s a tire at the side of the road there empty tire though no hubcap or anything I wonder how that even got there maybe it fell off the back of a lorry or something um another Royal Mail lorry coming in the opposite direction big hills in the distance big hills park and ride for Plymouth follow the signs in 1 mile *cough* we’re really coming up close now sheep on the left again in the field I'm really excited to get to arrive um all nerves about coming back home ah actually they're not gone they're not I was gonna say have been eclipsed by my excitement about stopping talking but that’s not gonna happen I don't think I I am I am still a bit weirded out about going back um really don't know why I think this is a good piece I hope so weird weird to think that someone might be reading what I'm saying right now in the future if I can follow through which I don't see why I wouldn't anymore I I've done this much um ok more cars up ahead now um kind of joining up with the cars a in front in front but not still not that many no traffic at all um which I am actually I am glad about but it would've been nice to have been able to describe the traffic jams but I guess that doesn't yeah it doesn't really matter um these roads are all the same these roads are so similar is is that a good title these roads are all the same that’s quite a good title *cough* I'll put it in the list oh I just coughed and it fogged up my glasses and I swerved I think I'll put that in a list of a list of possible titles at least if I can even remember the others that I've  said maybe when I go back through and listen through if I find a good sentence I'll make that the title really feel um the speed at which I'm going more acutely than I am usually aware of like really feel like I'm moving like t uh keeping up this constant flow of speech makes me realise the speed at which I'm moving and the nature of the amount of time it takes to do this drive so I guess that am I evaluating this piece while I'm doing it I guess so I guess so I'm um I'm passing a dirty white van and the back windscreen wiper has wiped off some of the dirt but its not covering up a its not wiping a window it’s just wiping the back of the white van that was really weird I'm passing a big 4 by 4 grey 4 by 4 on the left um and my little car pylons are so big when you're right next to them like they are really big there's a sign up ahead for a garden centre I think I remember seeing that garden centre on previous drives um I think the aviation centre I mentioned earlier is actually on the road to Norfolk not on the road here and I think that again kind of like backs my back this idea of roads being the same like when you're on a road it’s the same there was just a little warehouse down there bathroom showroom with a bath on the roof red bath on the roof of the white warehouse um little pole with a CCTV camera on it more signs more trees more grass more ditches more hills more roads more there’s a skid mark on the road a long skid mark on the road maybe from a previous oh yeah here’s the here’s the garden centre on the left it’s big and domed it has big uh doming glass roofs it’s empty it must be closed for the day I can't remember what time it is I'll make a note of what time it is when I get home um to the right there’s a quite a fancy looking restaurant called the hunting lodge with big gold letters and a stone wall and a white wall with a big silhouette of a horse on it big tower big tower in the distance real far distance looks very small on the horizon yellow field little solar panel on a post um a little far few farm houses on the horizon to the left and some wind turbines and pylons and wires and birds and there’s a big another big black warehouse with red borders like I mentioned a while ago a few hours ago couple hours ago I should say um car is passing me on the right um it’s quite a young guy driving with a with a beard perhaps like just graduated age I find it quite hard to work that shit out really uh little petrol station to the right and M1 to M5 no that’s a shit title um there’s a little um must what must have been a flower from the from the garden centre like a little plant pot and a flower uh sideways on the ground and in the middle of the barrier between this road and the opposite direction roads very loud on this part kinda sand papery rough it looks like with little patches of replaced smoother road really loud though um more fucking dead badgers everywhere why are there so many there’s so many dead animals like I can't tell what they are though they can't be rats because they're quite big but they're smaller than badgers I don't know what they could be um I'm coming in closer behind a red car in front and cone was toppled and tories = more war = more refugees graffiti under that bridge which I obviously agree with there’s a sign for Plympton so I really am close now and a little pig house and oh a little goose there’s a little goose a white goose um a little goose house I guess it must have been not a pig house on the right and more dead animals on the left and um signs and fences and hills and posts and the sun is coming down even lower now in the sky and deep lane the sign says up ahead deep lane um deep lane there’s a car joining the main road here on the left um I really feel embarrassed about my little breakdown during the second leg that really is strange to me haha it’ll be really weird to read over that again that was like so raw oh for fucks sake this car is going so slow and I can't can't cut across ok I am now oh I accidentally left footed the brake and really jolted my head there that was scary but I'm ok now I'm a bit trepidatious now ok here’s the sign saying welcome to Plymouth it’s faded and has a picture of a lighthouse on it and and dropping off to the left is just thousands of houses in the distance I can see I'll be coming down past like the kind of the water and the sand and the boats soon I think that’ll be nice to describe um the the way the sun and the clouds look right now is almost like the sun reflecting off of the water or off of but the surface of the moon I'm reminded of and there's all this tattered fabric on this fence to the left um there’s no wind though it’s been such a weatherless journey just grey skies the whole way I think the way it should be as well um the way it makes most sense I think curving up going up a hill curving round I recognise this area little plastic tree holders at the little bannister for a rail for a for a stair set and a dropping down into another ditch again um I'm taking the next exit I believe to go towards the sign that has the ferry on it I am yeah I remember this I know where I'm going now we’re really we’re really close and there’s a big hill with a big white uh asking all the way down it looks like a dry ski slope I don't know if it is that um I need to I don't know much about I don't know much about shit really there's another fucking dead badger there’s so many and on the left I can see water now here and a big kind of op Sydney Opera House looking Sainsbury’s is just there and a little bridge crossing the water and coming in and down and around all this twisting um roadways up on big concrete poles up and twisting around and all over and the sainsburys is quite empty as well it just feels everything feels abandoned right now everything feels empty and I'm coming to a stop at these traffic lights and I can see really close up grass on my left and I'm going up again now and there’s reeds on the right and yep we’re driving again following through the signs to the city centre there’s a Premier Inn on the right I'm not gonna just and then yeah the I'm on the left the there the just passing the Sainsbury’s that’s on the left there’s someone cycling on the path to the to the bus stop on the right there’s a bus stop on the left there’s signs there’s signs everywhere there’s fences there’s fewer trees there’s a speed camera um so I need to just slow down getting a bit carried there’s a big sign big brown sign with all the tourist attractions listed on it and to the left it dips down into the water um I don't know where I got this idea that there was boats and sand and shit there isn't there I don't know what I'm talking about I'm kind of I'm making stuff up um I need to slow down again I keep there's people jogging there's a lot of just water water water weird kind of ancient greek looking uh uh arches and stuff on the other side of the water up a hill uh looks really old I don't know what that what that building is um I'm turning off left off this road now going past I can see train tracks on the left there’s a petrol station on my right there’s um there’s flowers there’s daffodils there’s a cyclist I'm slowing down to 30 now for this going into a residential area no longer on the motorway the water looks quite rough I'm should be quite high tide I think and um lots of lots of textures to the water often looks quite smooth um I'm I think I'll stop describing soon because I'm really close now um it’s taken I'm I'm guessing around 4 and a half to 5 hours to do the drive not including the breaks um I'm really tired there’s a flag above a garage on the right and I'm and there’s pylons still and I just hit the curb um I just hit the curb but I'm ok I'm just I need to focus these roads are narrow they go down to 20 there’s lots of houses everywhere I'm I'm getting emotional again because I'm getting to the end um and I've never thought about a trip like this um there are shops there’s people walking around there’s I recognise these roads obviously I drive them a lot um my legs are aching and my my arms feel quite empty seeing some vote Labour signs there’s a bus coming the other direction um I’ll be home soon and then I’ll unpack and um and I don't know what I’ll do after that I don't know yet I haven't thought that far ahead I've got to go to college tomorrow and um I hope that all of this is again I just repeating myself over and over in this thing I guess all of the slight variations of wording are different there’s a little uh trailer filled with rubble there and a little motorbike and cars parked all along the sides of these roads and houses and telephone poles and wires and lamp posts and um going down a really steep hill now this is a bitch of an area um to drive all these hills um there’s a little park playground area and some steep hills uh like banks up to houses and a really old metal bridge with uh oh fuck really what are you doing slowing down so much what the fuck man I would turning in here there’s a dog taking a shit um haha oh no it was just pissing it was pissing on the side and the pee is running down the path and there’s not many people around and I'm turning up left here and I'm really really close to being home someone just pulled out really far in front this is fucking Plymouth man um going up this really steep devil hill cars on the side and have to look round these blind corners while on a hill and turning it’s just such a nightmare ok I've made it I've  made it I'm up I'm going up um I'm this is madness this is madness I can't believe I'm doing this um I'm really almost home now hopefully there'll be a nice place to park on the road I really hope so I'm not entirely sure there will be though there's cars everywhere I think everyone’s home from work so the road will be filled there's a beautiful tree um just past a nice lightly painted wall uh with pink blossom and ornate metal fences and stuff around and this little terrace area and I'm turning turning right now almost onto my street the road before my street on the right is on the right is a park a um there’s cars all parked up everywhere I'm not gonna find anywhere to park I can I can tell now um I'm turning right onto my road turning onto my road the road is looking full yep as predicted there’s a space there actually but I'm I'm just gonna keep going a little bit further on and just see if there’s anywhere better don't fucking think there is though I've fucked this up shit it’s really busy gonna have to go down and back around and park um up on that area that I pointed out hopefully no ones taking it while I'm gone um it’s really narrow around this area all of the houses are pastel pale pastel colours um it is it is pretty go up here up this cobble path bins all all along the sides and I'm hoping that works I think um I think I can do this its really bumpy um very steep there’s bins everywhere haha I'm actually round the back of my house um which is weird I've never haha drive driven down the back before can see my house there ok and then turning out here and then hopefully the space will still be there it is so I’ll just park up here quickly it’s quite tight but I think I'm alright ok there we are I've parked um and I've turned the engine off so I'm gonna stop the recording now I'm I'm finished I uh yeah.
