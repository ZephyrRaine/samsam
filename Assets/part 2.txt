alright recording part 2 begins right now I've just filled up on petrol and I'm coming out of the petrol station now I feel like that was exactly the right thing to do I feel way more refreshed um I just this this was really strange in the car in front of me was someone like in the car parked in front of me from a sorry in front of me at the petrol station was someone that was in my year at school who id never ever spoken to but who I've heard a lot about recently um for various reasons and it is just like incredibly strange he was there and we kind of like noticed and we were like what the fuck and I said that is this is really really strange and he was like yeah this is really strange and that was it and like I think we were both so shocked that we didn't know what to say um and its really bizarre because its like I id never spoken to him I don't know him probably don't like him he its I don't know where he lives but he doesn't live around he doesn't live here in Reading he doesn't go to university he goes to university up North so there’s like no reason we should be bumping into each other so that’s bizarre um but yeah I had a coffee I filled up on petrol I feel ready to go I feel more enthused again about this idea I think that whatever happens and whatever comes of it is gonna it is what it is and the idea is the idea and I think that there’s something good about that there’s another lake to my left here maybe these are reservoirs because I can't image that they're naturally forming lakes around here there’s like buoys floating in it and stuff and some little islands and I don't well maybe I don't know if you have buoys and islands in reservoirs because they're manmade so I guess it is a lake there are rivers around here I suppose there’s another lake coming up now in the service station when I was getting the coffee um the barrister asked me if I wanted a receipt oh no that’s ok and then she kind of looked at me again as if she hadn’t heard me so I was like oh no that’s ok and then she kind of looked really confused and then kept looking at me and I was like what what’s going on in my head and then she started talking to someone behind me and it was just like a really really strange encounter and I feel like I made I did something wrong but I also know what that I didn’t haha I didn’t do anything wrong so that was weird it was quite a quiet service station and according to my phone it’s only going to take three hours from here which is obviously good um that means that I'm about a quarter of the way of talking but I guess when you think of it that way that’s still quite a lot to go but that’s y’know that’s not that’s not a disastrous amount of time I don’t think um there’s a truck to my left that has wooden planks and metal poles and a concrete or plaster bucket holding things and they’re all kind of exposed on the outside of this truck being held on with like bungee cord and I always wonder how those like don’t just have more accidents where they fall off the back and things because that seems like really unsafe to me um I remember that service station when I went to the King of Limbs with {…} I think I said this before uh driving to Wiltshire and we described the situation being like redoing an early level of a video game after having levelled up and gotten more experience and more knowledge and understanding because the first time we went to the King of Limbs we got the train and we camped and after we got off at the station we realised we were in the completely wrong area and there was no buses apart from one in like two hours so we waited around in this very small town and we went into this pub and everyone looked at us like we were lost and we were and we felt like outsiders and we got this bus and we got the bus to the town where the campsite was but the campsite wasn’t accessible by walking and we didn’t have a map so we had to walk up the side of a dual carriage to the campgrounds and then when we got there it like stormed all night and our tent our leaked and got all our equipment wet our like camera equipment and then the next day {…} was like oh we don't need a map we should try and find it ourselves that’s like the theme of the trip and so we got completely lost in this massive forest this ancient forest for the whole day we didn't have any food or water and it was boiling hot and then we we were wandering around and we found this like group of people having barbecues by a giant obelisk and they didn't know the way and they didn't offer us any food and then we found a cottage with like a water mill and someone chopping wood and he pointed us the right no and then he didn't know but then his daughter turned up she drove up and thought I guess we were robbing them or something but we weren't and she gave us directions um and then when we managed to find our way to the tree finally and it was well off the beaten track we wouldn't have found it if this hadn't happened and we went we were sitting up in this tree just like chilling listening to music I think we might've yeah yeah and then an old man turns up with like a quiver over his shoulder and some sticks poking out of it and we were like what are you doing here and he said I make wands and he was a wand maker and he was talking to us about how the the tree the wood from this tree was special especially magic and spiritual because it was well over a 1000 years old all of the energy from the people that had ever been past it and all the energy from all the trees around had been absorbed into the wood and so and he would only pick up the sticks that had naturally fallen um and we also found out that he used to live in or own I can't remember the giant mansion that’s in the forest that Radiohead recorded In Rainbows in so that’s haha just like and then when we drove back this was in summer and when we drove back in the winter of the same year we just drove there we drove straight up to the tree we got out we got what we needed and we left and it was like a completely different experience and we’ve learnt from the previous time and we’ve gained new skills and new understandings and matured and grown up I think in a lot of ways and and I think this was this yeah this was after my first my first few months at southampton and {…}’s first few months in LA and so we’d both had a quite rough informative times and we’ve come back and everything was different and we went back to this place and so that’s what that service station reminded me of and to some extent these roads I remember both times on the trips we had kind of mystical encounters with birds on the train on the way back the train went through a tunnel came out of the tunnel sounded like the horn and then suddenly the carriage was filled with feathers like feathers came in shooting in through the windows and sunlight came in through the windows and we don't know what had happened maybe the train had hit hit a group of doves or something but there were all these feathers all in the air and it felt quite like the moment at the beginning of A Zed and Two Noughts where there’s feathers everywhere um when the swan causes the car crash and then on the on the car trip there were lots of flocks of black birds filling completely completely filling the sky like apocalyptic Hitchcock black birds and so the summer trip was the white bird feathers and then the winter trip was the black bird swarms and I think that’s I don't know why me and {…} always had these kind of mythical experiences but we did and all of our time together was kind of defined by these occasions and driving these roads now on my own I don't feel like I am gonna have anything like that I guess happening upon I knew that I went to my school and then I guess there have been a few weird things like that inflatable obstacle course floating in that lake but nothing to the same scale um nothing of the same spirituality to it there’s a lot of fallen trees to my left in these woods and the light is reflective off the dark green leaves in it really nice way and the trees coming out of this hill are bending upright um because they’re coming out on an angle and they’re bending upright and it’s really amazing to me how I mean obviously I know how it works like scientifically but it’s still cool to see trees and plants knowing the direction of gravity and the direction of the sun and things like that and that they’re without knowing it they’re following these kind of cosmic laws um a car just passed with a roof a roof box on um we used to have roof boxes when we travelled up to Norfolk but we don’t do that anymore we all drive up independently um so there’s no need to put all the luggage in one car there’s some little dirt tracks and gates and fences and hedgerows and a small stream and old thick trees bending in and out of the stream going up and down and around it reminds me of the scenery in those fishing DVDs that I've  been collecting and making me think I still need to work on that film I'm gonna make out of those um the bracken and thicket on the right now is that same orangey yellow flower colour and in the trees there’s like hundreds of bird nests that you can see very clearly because they have no leaves on them at the moment I wonder if t was um if the birds are living there all at once there’s a patch of newly growing evergreen trees to the right I guess pine trees or perhaps some kind of like it can’t be a fruit or anything and there’s a giant herd of cows to the right as well on top of a hill and they're all standing up so I guess that means that it’s not gonna rain um there are lots and lots of them all clumped together um I'm wondering about what I should call this piece I'm thinking either naming it after the route uh Redbourn to Plymouth 16th april or something like road thoughts or road road words no that sounds shit um engines and raindrops is such I think one of my best titles but I've already called something that oh there's a deer in that field just in the standing in a young deer in the middle of that field next to a telegraph pole completely empty it doesn't look like it was going anywhere or doing anything but it wasn't hurt or anything it didn't look like still on a um section of road with those cats eye division thinning road sections uh for road works you can see a house with some washing tied up down to the left of me I need to be careful not to overlap into the lane on the right I am losing concentration a bit trying to notice too much I'm hot again um I took my jumper off at the service station and I've turned the air con down but I'm sweating and sticking to the seat and it’s amazing to me how sore my throat is getting from doing this it doesn't feel like it should be because I'm not shouting but I guess just talking constantly does have an actual effect there was a learner pulled off to the side there it looked like they might have crashed I don't know I don't know what a learner is doing on a motorway you're not allowed to be on a motorway if you're a learner um I can see coming up ahead the road is going back to normal and back to full speed so that’s good um I had the idea at the service station of how to format the book I think I'm gonna make it a landscape book uh comic strip shaped like the Calvin and Hobbes books I'm thinking about um and the text will be formatted into one line um on each page continuous going across each page um without any punctuation and beneath the line will be the waveform of the audio file that I'm recording because I definitely want to draw attention to the fact that it was audio like speech um and I want to turn the immaterial ephemeral ethereal aspect of an audio file into something physical that’s the important part about making it a book I think I'm not expecting people to want to buy and read this book but I want to turn this moment in time into something that you can hold and flick through the turning of pages being kind of like the rolling of wheels um I don't know how to translate the sounds but going over these little dips in the road um and the car like clunking rhythmically with the wheels like that one shot in Inside Llewyn Davis where he’s um hitchhiking along the motorway at night and it goes to a front view from the bumper over these little lines in the road and it’s going chu dum chu dum try and recreate that with the turning of pages rather than because punctuation is obviously a rhythmical thing but because this is so stream of consciousness and not formatted into sentences I don't know if it would make sense if there would be punctuation and I actually don't know how the dictation software works whether it recognises sentences and creates punctuation for you or if you have to say comma comma full stop colon semi colon I wonder right now if those are typed out as words or if those are typed out as symbols I wonder if it will recognise any of this at all again over the over the road noise I don’t know it’s hard to say um the road is becoming more flat and less hilly and the fields and banks each side have flattened out the horizon feels straighter flatter more distant more circular I feel like the circular radius of my sight is the only thing that exists right now like discworld or the flat earth theory or something or like the idea that only what you see exists and behind you doesn't exist until you turn around and look at it but because I'm looking at the moment through mirrors constantly I'm fully aware of everything around me like I can see behind me I can see to my sides I can left and right and all around but only within the parameters of my vision um and because I’m moving constantly nothing is the same everything looks the same everything is more green fields rising and falling and lines across these fields and a little road coming down between these fields hedgerows barns what looks like a field of buttercups or perhaps like um rapeseed or trees and this tree and this sign and power boxes and big disused electronic signs that don't have anything and posts and bollards and barriers and handrails for little steps stairways that go nowhere and houses that are connected to nothing and there's no pylons around here there's lorries there’s cars there’s lines on the road you can see the faded marks from where lines used to be oh f yeah go on fucking overtake me then I can't what are you expecting me to do I can't go out in front of you I'm stuck behind a slow ok thank you fuck sake and that pylon those telegraph poles are quite old looking wooden and they’re do they are they are they are they phone wires do phone wires exist anymore do phone lines travel across wires they do don't they not through the air I don't know I'm wondering what everyone in these cars around me are doing right now if they're listening to music listening to the radio I wonder if they're listening to the same radio stations as each other I wonder if they're talking if they're on their own where they're going to if they're doing stupid art pieces like me there was another plastic bag in that tree again there's just so iconic that image um just overtaken a sunglasses wearing slick looking old guy in a BMW and I feel quite good about myself haha for doing that looked like there was a skate park down to the side but I think it was just industrial area got skateboarding on the brain um there’s some cute little cartoonish houses down there I've put on on the I plugged my iPod in when I was at the service station and I'm playing that piece of music I made Driving Music which is an hour and a half long stretch of Johnny Mathis’ Misty which is my favourite song and it’s stretched and muffled so that it sounds like um ambient car noises um and I'm listening to that to try and create some other noise other than just my own voice which is really strange I've gotta say like it is a weird feeling um and maybe I'll encourage people to listen to that piece while they’re reading this I don't know um maybe I'll encourage them right now to yeah haha start listening to it right now you're reading what I'm saying right now if you are start listening to that its free its online maybe if I turn this into a video I'll have that as the background would it be a 4 hour video or would my the text would come out maybe faster than I'm speaking probably I don't know how many times have I said I don't know and um I'll have to delete all the ums or maybe I wont I don't know the cars around me right now all seem to be quite bright whites and light greys and I feel almost like I’m in a pack with them like a pack of white wolves running across uh paved over fields or something up mountain sides quite a communal feel I'm expecting when I get into Bristol and Exeter that there’ll be a lot of traffic very slow moving traffic and there’ll be a sense of I like that sense of community that develops in that kind of situation I wonder if I wonder how easy it is to get into lorry driving because I think it’s a job I would quite enjoy and I believe it’s quite well paid but it is also very unhealthy and soul crushing I imagine like quite boring but quite peaceful I don’t know really vast fields right now endless fields I'm thinking about that film A Field in England and I’m thinking I really would like to make a film about motorway travel but I don’t know how because I don’t have the c the ability to record audio in a car very well I could dub it I suppose and make it stylistic I do wanna make something more narrative though and have the stylistic artistic elements feed into a narrative and be punctuated by narrative scenes like im thinking about Mirror which y’know I mentioned this earlier and I watched it two days ago and for every symbolic imagery and slow image based scenes there's like a realistic narrative scene as well um and I think that’s important um maybe to keep up a flow because I find it very difficult to watch purely abstract long form video content um apart from maybe Bill Morrison but even that I haven't sat through Decasia which is like 70 minutes because that felt that felt too long um I'm starting to feel a little bit more excited and optimistic and happy about returning to Plymouth um I I have been very worried about it and have enjoyed my time at home but I think that I I think I'm on the right path and I need maybe to be in that environment in order to work more consistently there's some black there's some black mounds really solid black mounds in that field they look almost sic fi there's they must be dirt but they're so much darker than all the other dirt around perhaps compost like compost that was shipped in or something but that was really bizarre almost like these heaps of shadow just like placed in this field we’ve got more services coming but it definitely not time for another break yet I've only just started again really there’s a um a convertible blue car passing by on the left right there and one of those electronic signs says 40 and caution has a queue sign on it and there’s a blown out uh warehouse to my left and a giant post giant totem pole looking I guess uh satellite pole or something I don't know what you would call that to the right really really tall from here um with all these wires connecting it maybe oh it might be a lightning oh yeah that’s what it is it'll be a lightning lightning rod that’s what they called yeah to protect all the cars I guess and buildings around this area because there's nothing else at all um oh there was no queue the sign says end again now so that’s good at least there's another solar farm on the left here I'm getting a little more of a glimpse of the actual panel they're very bright just reflecting the sky um again I'm just thinking about Bob Ross again I'm thinking it would be it would've been interesting if Bob Ross had ever stepped out of his comfort zone and painted like industrial haha industrial Britain and kind of like wasteland-y landscapes in the same style as his beautiful mountains and trees and lakes like applying his same ideas to to this kind of area and I know that he’s done some areas some like buildings and things but they never seem quite right and these are landscapes I'm talking about so I don't know I I would like to s yeah I wanna I wanna watch some Bob Ross tonight to fall asleep to I think that’d be nice I'm getting quite I'm uh I'm conscious of the fact that I'm getting quite internal now my arms feel suddenly very heavy and what must’ve been a caffeine rush in my head is fading oh I feel I feel weird all of a sudden I feel bubbling and empty and m and sad I don't know why I feel ah I don't know I'm really fed up at the moment I feel almost like I'm in a confessional now I'm just I I’m I feel like I'm going I'm I'm really not I'm going nowhere and I'm really I feel so abandoned and a a a at the complete mercy of the way everyone else treats me and that if everyone decided to leave which it feels like people slowly are I don't know if that’s just pessimism talking but I feel like if people left I wouldn't be strong enough to be on my own and I don't know if I don't know I don't wanna get into that kind of thing I think I can see some sheep in the distance and that ffff and the way the sun is falling on these fields is making them really pale and washed out and there there’s fields really going off into the distance now fading off into the distance so much that they’re getting foggy and they’re light greens and they’re light browns and they’re darker greens but they’re all desaturated and there’s crows and sheep and yellow fields golden fields coming up up in up on the distance and I feel like I'm going down now into a valley perhaps and there’s tall trees but they’re so far away that they're small and speckly and scratchy I'm getting closer to the sheep now and you can see how much grass the sheep have been eating because the field looks quite dead and there's like a little trough which must have water in for the sheep or food perhaps there's all these weird little tufts and fences and I'm going really slow now but there's too many cars I can't uh gonna pull out now in front of this one overtake this highway maintenance van maybe it’s the one I saw earlier I don't think so um the suns breaking through the grey clouds and there's patches of grey blue and the sun is shining bright on those fields to my left making the green really bright and vibrant compared to all the other fields around and the plastic bottles and dust and dirt and stones the dark in the shadow of that little mound and there's a tractor coming across that field and to my right there's a cartoonishly round hill with a metal grid like pole post tower on top of it um with no wires connecting it to anywhere I don't know what it’s doing and there's two old white cottages with thatched roofs that I can see hidden by some trees and I'm shaking my hands and arms are shaking and I don't know why I s I just saw the number 120 on on a concrete wall a part of a bridge that went over the road I hope ah I feel feel really weird I don't know what it is I feel really shaky and unstable and weak and suddenly very nervous again about everything and all of this um I really hope this is recording I'm really scared if I don't have any if this doesn't work I have no more ideas I'm so completely out of ideas I've been working so much recently that I feel like I've completely drained myself of everything and I've been doing so much that I can't tell what’s good and not anymore that car that just drove past I saw *cough* I saw in my window that the oh I'm getting really weak and light headed oh god I'm gonna try and have a drink of oh no this bottle’s empty I thought it would had water in it earlier but it doesn't there's a cloud of dust um I don't know what it is why I'm why am I getting into such a panic I'm not gonna have a panic attack on the road am I oh god um ok I need to ok I'll try and calm down oh there's two lines of cars going in either directions on these two bridges um and there's black and red cars in front of me and a maroon van coming up behind me I think I'm getting hot I think that’s what it is I think I'm getting too hot and sweaty and I think that maybe the coffee was a bad idea um but I'm ok I'm ok and oh god this is really horrible feeling I feel really exposed and like I'm at complete mercy of nature or something I don't know why I feel like I feel when I had that panic attack on the plane on the way to america when I was watching Spotlight there's a really beautiful spiral pathway concrete pathway going over the road just there I've never seen that before it looks almost like the front horns of a male goat or something oh the lorry in front of me just slipped off onto the side track and blew up a load of dust and grit into ma into my way and I couldn't see anything so I pulled pulled over to the right um I hope that I hope they're ok they hope they weren't falling asleep at the wheel the driver um ah I feel really lonely um just talking to myself like this there's a pile of rubbish and logs pile of logs to the side of the road there um and more wires criss crossing around between poles and there's someone coming up behind me on a motorbike looking like a chopper kind of thing um I wonder I think I would feel very frightened on a motorbike very exposed um there wearing a camo top which is funny and brown trousers and I'm passing a blue lorry on my left there's some houses off on the distance towards the left with cars driving around in front of them so I guess I guess we are near some kind of road that goes past oh my voice is trembling I feel really unwell haha um I'm kind of laughing but I'm feeling really scared actually um I've I don't know why I feel like this maybe I need more to eat or something I don't know I'm holding onto my jumper now I am scared its gonna sound like I'm making this up for the for the piece but I'm really not this has never happened I don't maybe if I wasn't focusing so much on my thoughts I wouldn't be getting into such a panic like this it feels almost like when when I was doing therapy and I had to when I was having an episode and I would have to write down all of my thoughts very specifically and analyse all of them it feels like that and I wonder if maybe I'm getting back into that headspace I don’t know I feel I do feel I'm I'm I don't know what it is but this journey is making me think a lot about my time on the planes to America my time in America when I was visiting {…} my ex girlfriend um I'll probably take her name out when I'm editing this yeah I will I'll make a note or this is the note I suppose and during that I stayed over there for a long summer and regularly had panic attacks and breakdowns and episodes um because of the way because of the things that happened over there my feelings the feeling of being so stuck in another place that was so different from home so isolated and afraid and hungry so really hungry all the time and I had to sleep on the floor in their laundry room um on a mattress on the floor I didn't feel welcome when I was over there for months and I felt really at that time and also at that time I was coming back coming to and from southampton a lot and I felt really like I had no proper home and I know that’s something Sebald talks about but at that time I really felt like I had no home and trying to feel like my home was maybe with her in the states but it really wasn't and then when I came back home real home to my family home I think my parents might’ve felt quite confused about well I was going through a lot at the time and I think they felt worried and didn't know how to deal with it and and I know I did and and southampton wasn't my home but I spent a lot of time down there even though id stopped university I still lived down there and I I I feel like those months have compl I don't a ah I wish I wasn't talking about this I don't this isn't what I wanted to happen I felt like those times have been completely wiped from my brain there were months that I spent down there where I didn't know I didn't go to university I didn't have a job I didn't do anything and I have no recollection of anything I did while I was there and it’s really frightening and I don't like remembering this that I don't know why this exercise is bringing this back into my mind all of these fucking fields look the same there’s more there’s another solar farm here and I guess like I'm seeing more of the fronts again now they must face towards the South right thats where like the direction that gets the most sun um the roads are very flat around here and the middle track between the two directions is growing little white flowers um the road noise is very loud right now and I really hope that I'll be able to hear myself more over the dictation software will be able to hear me when I translate this across now um I am very committed to this idea now though I think I think I will definitely do that I'm I wonder if anybody in all these cars is seeing seeing me talking I wonder what they think I'm doing I wonder if they think I'm on the phone everyone is so nameless and faceless when they're travelling on motorways like this everyone just becomes their car all you think of you think of the cars as people you feel you feel like you yourself are a car and you feel like the people around you are also cars I don't know if that makes sense I'm gonna absolutely take another break at the next service station and get some food I feel very weak really frightened still um unstable I'm I'm glad that I'm documenting all of this at least the area that I'm driving right now has these keep two chevrons apart type things and I think the word chevron is really funny its the only context in which you ever think of you only ever hear this road that that word sorry the in the distance the the light and the fog and the clouds are blurring the horizon into the skyline in a really beautiful way it feels kinda like a um oh my my hands and arms have gone are tingling I and I feel really I'm sweating and I feel really unwell if it keeps going on I'm gonna have to stop and but I don't really want to I think that this is something something is happening here it’s really tiring myself up it’s so hot in this car I'm turning up the air conditioning that’s much better actually I need water and I need a I need a snack maybe a little sandwich or something the next station this next station I will definitely pull up in I didn't I was suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry rather than to just keep going and try and get it done quickly um there’s some white houses over there um more more green fields lots just so many fields really noticing how many fields oh I feel really unwell there’s a lorry with a QR code on the back are they really encouraging people that are driving to use their phone to scan that to look at the website of this logistics company thats so stupid man what the fuck I really I really am wondering if I'm gonna have to stop I don't know what to do I'm really I'm getting myself into a panic that’s what’s happening I think it’s am I having a panic attack while I'm fucking recording oh this is so stupid I'm such a fucking idiot I hate myself so much sometimes just like uh all the time I don't treat oh no what am I no I don't need to get into this I don't need to get into this I'm I'm sweating a lot my legs are split wide apart um I'm just gently on the accelerator keeping between 60 and 70 it’s not too busy on this road quite nice speed I'm going not too not too many cars I am thirsty my mouth feels sticky and dry my throat is sore the clouds to the left are getting darker and more dense looks like it will rain over that way and then in front of me there are s uh sun beams coming down there’s a sign for an attraction called Wookey Hole Wookey spelt like the Star Wars thing I don't know what that is I remember that there are a lot of interesting signs on this journey like Cheddar Gorge and I know obviously um oh I can't remember Trago Mills and things like that and all these fantasy sounding names and perhaps actually that’s that’s maybe an idea of a film I could do is a recontextualise and reconsider my idea for a retelling of the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit through a modern lens and make a kind of surreal fantasy parody of well not parody but fantasy-inspired journey across motorways and things like a road trip across motorways and things that has the feeling of an epic fantasy quest um oh i’d like to do a ghost story on motorways but I feel like I would be ripping off Kentucky Route Zero too much and I don't know that’s not a good idea definitely um I'm really tired I'm feeling a bit better though I am hungry I think maybe I think it’s the coffee has spun me out maybe I shouldn't have had that it was nice though haha uh it was nice that’s a colour of a car you don't see often kinda orange ooh I had oh weird deja vu there I don't know I'm remembering some kind of I'm remembering driving {…} back from from there was a dead animal at the side of the road there that looked quite big almost like a tapir I wonder what that was I'm remembering driving her back from Plymouth and her falling asleep and being happy but also stressed out and wanting time alone but now that I am alone I desperately want anything but that I've enjoyed seeing uh I'm not gonna say her name I'm not gonna say anyone’s names I'll cut that bit out over this two weeks off that’s been nice oh I wish I hadn't said this I should cut this all out maybe I won't is it more truthful I don't know uh *cough* there’s a bigger highway maintenance truck that I'm just passing now um really sweating a lot really panicking a lot but also calm there's sheep on the left sheep on the left pylons cones grass tufts some teenagers with a no some guys their van must’ve broken down they’re towing a boat they’re sitting on a fence hay bales covered in plastic black plastic sheets another broken down car with a guy leaning against a signpost oh who are they waiting for um and there’s a house up on a hill and there’s a sign telling river we’re passing the river Avon I guess is what the sign says um I wonder how long I've  been going for on this stretch I'm just gonna just gonna check uh 48 minutes in this stretch it’s half past 4 so if I can find another service station that will it’s not a terrible place to stop I don't I guess I wonder all in all how long this text is gonna end up being uh I don't know I'm looking myself in the mirror now the rear view mirror and I can see that haha I'm frowning um my hair is short and I'm not used to it yet and I don't like it I wish I hadn't got it cut today id rather grow it out my lips are chapped and peeling and dry um the reflection of my glasses is green it always is um I really need a break it’s so hot and tiring doing this um I think maybe that the next station I might stop I don't know I'm gonna decide what to do I'm sweating a lot really stressing me out I really don't know what to do I think I feel almost like I'll stop trying oh god I haven't seen any signs for services in ages but there must be some soon I was feeling so enthused 50 minutes ago um I am still committed I feel I think it’s a good idea I don't know I just don't know what to do really there’s ok I might be coming on to the M5 soon but there is a services in 1 mile so that’s good I'm gonna come off here only be a few minutes I guess um there’s an M&S so I'll get a wrap or something to eat um I don't know I'm such a mess really disappointed in myself i’d really hate to fail on this idea I don't wanna crash do anything silly and reckless I need to read that book Crash always come back to this idea of car crashes they're so visceral my hands are all tingling still like I'm something wrong these services are more tucked away than the last ones in the woodland it seems um must be a bit smaller I reckon than the ones at Reading that would make sense I suppose I don't know if I've ever stopped at these ones before I don't think I have they're quite quiet um yeah I'm parking quite near the front um soon I will stop this recording and either this’ll be it or I'll start another recording soon just pulling in now
