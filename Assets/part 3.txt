ok im starting the recording of part 3 and I'm *cough* I took a while and I'm feeling a bit better but I'm going to be more careful this time and if I'm not feeling ok again I'm gonna stop because I don't wanna die for this really shit bullshit piece of performance or whatever the fuck this is it’s shit so I'm gonna take it a bit more casually and a bit more slowly and just get through it and take more breaks I think is important as well but I do think this is something I should finish I don't think there's any point in stopping half way through because it doesn't make any sense to do that so fingers crossed I don't fucking crash I'm just pulling off and coming back on to the main motorway road now from the station I've had a little snack and I've got some water so I should be fine and I'm listening to I've put on on on on my iPod Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians which is a nice kind of a nice piece which has a lot of momentum to it and I think that’ll help keep me focused and keep me ok and keep me out of my head so that I don't get too emotional again just keep focused on driving and focused on feeling ok there was a weird um tower in the distance over there that was like an upside down triangle and I'm wondering what that is and how that’s staying upright it’s very weird and a fence there with some barbed wire I don't know what that’s keeping out I can't I can't see inside to have a look um and a farm house big farm house and there’s a care bus with some old people in it overtaking me to the right oh and um volunteer drivers required it says so I guess that the driver is doing this free of charge which is interesting I suppose no it’s not what am I just not even this is so f I'm I'm really unhappy I'm really unhappy I'm about I'm not even half way and I've already nearly died and I've run out of things to talk about I'm feeling ok at least though not shaking anymore but yeah not not talking as much this time the pylons around here are really really big and really tower over all the trees and hedges and the houses you never really think about how many there are but there are so many and they have such a distinctive design they really stand out they don't look like anything natural the closest thing you could say they look like are trees I suppose but they don't look natural enough to be compared with them and to my left there are some horses there there’s a white one with black spots on it and a brown one with some houses there and more pylons going off into the distance and smoke smoke coming from somewhere that’s fogging and obscuring all of the buildings someone is having a bonfire I think I can smell it now in the car um that smokey bacon smell again haha smokey bacon crisps bacon crispies from Aldi quite a beautifully designed trailer there pale yellows and pale greys for some kind of Swedish company trees in fields either look like guardians like watchful guardians or like groups of friends hanging out depending on how many there are I really wish there was someone with me I really wish I had a dog I think I saw a pig sty over there a pigloo as I like to call them because they look like kinda like igloos and there’s some horses again the pattern under that bridge was almost like a mosaic I wonder if that’s what they’re going for how many times have I said wonder yeah I am feeling a lot better actually I think I'll do ok this time just need to take more breaks it’ll be worth it in the end like that guy that spent a week with a coyote y’know he didn’t stop being like oh I think I I could I'm having a panic attack it’s like he stuck it out so did like Marina Abramović like whatever all of that so I think I I I mean I'm not comparing myself to them but I'm saying like I have to do this and then ultimately people are gonna be reading through all of this text that I'm saying right now and it’s not gonna be it’s not gonna make sense how someone could get so emotional and fragile and scared by just talking in a car and I can't explain it it was like something completely overtook me I'm worried it'll happen again but it was like I wasn't I really thought something terrible was gonna happen I really I was completely overcome by fear and anxiety and I don't know I think I might be near Bristol now nearish at least which is c good I'm making good time um I'm making good time sign sign up ahead says that Bath is n Bath uh the road coming off soon goes to Bath so that’s pretty close to Bristol and I’m pretty sure that um yeah I don't know I'm wondering what I'm wondering about people’s reactions when I show them this piece I hope it goes down well I hope so I don't know wow that field was really nice lots of little brown sticky up little dry sticky scratchy plants and more kind of dead grass and being pressed back into sign up ahead says report of debris so should need to be careful on the lookout for that I don't see any yet I wonder what that could mean if maybe something has fallen off the back of a lorry or a van or something so many plastic bags and bottles everywhere all along the side so many and they’ll just be there for ever like they'll never get anybody coming up really like walking along the banks of a motorway cleaning and even if they did there would just be more more would just appear like they'll always be there the way the hedges are darker and contrasting against the grass in the fields makes them look like a quilt and like patched together and I know that’s not like a new idea or a new image but it really does seem that way like someone has sewn together this patchwork landscape laid it over some lumps and stuck some fucking pylons in the in the grass like I don't know another solar field solar farm it’s good that there are more solar farms being built but why are there not more haha like because there’s so many grassy empty fields so many all I do is describe fields fields getting more blue as they go into the distance fields in divided by hedgerows fields with trees fields with pylons fields with animals ploughed fields dead fields um newly grown fields fields with crops in fields with solar panels in fields with holes fields with tufts a ferrari just passed me on the right you have to be such a prick to drive a ferrari don't you it has like a hum like a loud audible hum that says I'm driving an expensive car look at me people know exactly what they're doing when they're driving a car like that I would never do that even if I had loads of money I would never drive a car like that I’d like to get one of those car air fresheners that’s like a cardboard p like a piece of cardboard that looks like a pine tree I think they're so funny or furry dice they're hilarious I would love to get one of them I should gets in the way though I've got quite a small front window so a windscreen I mean more newly growing trees there with a plastic tubing round their bases and there’s a motorbike here with a metal box on the back that must have some of his shit in I don't know what though look very like um it looked really heavyweight those boxes I don't know how to explain to my right there's some sewage works or water tanks or something like that and perhaps connecting to these buildings that are kind of nearby in the distance that put that like stuff way out of the way of everything else so all the there’s some houses to the left lots of houses actually it looks like they've just been built because there's still building works and freshly kind of dug up ground near by but they’ve they've all got um quite nice pastelley pale colours to them which is nicer than a lot of um oh no I spoke too soon they're actually all like that horrible new brick colour that new houses are that nothing else is that colour apart from new buildings and they look disgusting oh there’s another report of debris sign up ahead um telling us to go down to 40 now so I wonder what that’s about who reports the debris who does that some busy body like phoning up like oh hello there was there's some debris in the road like I dunno who does that like yeah there's a another sign up again saying to slow down and actually now there's a now there's some road works so I'm slowing down for that anyway um obviously some people aren’t but haha but I am I tell you what I'm gonna sleep well tonight I don't know there’s a tree coming up which looks quite like a an acacia tree one of those kind of trees that you'll see in like the grasslands um in a uh I'm remembering like zoo tycoon or like the lion king or something it’s got that kind of shape to it but it is just like a oh weird it’s actually a pine tree that’s just really crooked and bent over almost like a bonsai a giant bonsai that’s been carved and twisted and trained over years lost it maybe it maybe it’s just been following maybe there was something there covering up its access to the sun and it had to move and grow in that way to change looks like the traffic is coming to a standstill up here I don't know why um only the left lane though really suddenly stopped actually I wonder what that was about I'm gonna have some water some horses I can see to the left there it’s really tiny tiny yellow sign that says danger overhead cables and it’s like oh great yeah thanks but um oh shit I need to I'm in the wrong lane oh no I dropped the water bottle oh that is a disaster oh no I've got it back actually I reached haha reached behind me and got it back that’s why this traffic slowed down so much it was for coming off here on to the M32 it'll be quite fun maybe to go over google maps and work out my um and plot the route and work out when I'm saying these things to show through distance like show my words through distance perhaps that could be a component of the book as well I don't know because I am I am keeping um good flow on my speech it’s I haven’t really taking more time between sentences now just so that I don't fucking faint again but like um we’ll be able to all like maybe I could I don't know there’s gonna be too many words to be able to do anything like stretch them across a map or something like but I could do that that might be interesting I don't know if I printed the map really really big perhaps there are too many words I am coming up to oh not Bristol I don't think almost almost Bristol we’ll be coming off onto the M5 soon um which is good I think that’s the final after Bristol I got to Exeter and then from Exeter to Plymouth so I'm I'm there’s not too far left I'm happy that I'm still going there's more um rusting fences and barbed wire on the left here and there's been thats j the barbed wire is just protecting a bank there’s no animals there’s nothing behind the barbed wire and the barbed wire just stops so you can easily get round it so I don't understand why it’s there because it’s not keeping anything out or keeping anything in so I don't I don't know what the deal is with that on the right it looks like some new fences constructed in some farmland um perhaps a race course it looked like maybe I'm not sure there's a tree that I just passed that is very pale in colour and ashy and burnt out and there's some sheep again in the distance and some birds sitting on wires and some wires going down into the ground dense with foliage that will never be accessed again I don't expect like till far into the future I don’t know I I always think this to myself um on trips but if you really really wanted to hide like really wanted to hide there are some like patches of but like plants and stuff next to motorways that won’t ever ever ever be looked in ever and you could definitely like hide in like a wood or something and never be found and I mean maybe maybe I'm seriously underestimating the abilities of like the authorities or but I don’t know on the right there’s a either a blown up no it’s being constructed but it’s like a big building that’s being constructed and you can see all of the insides of it all of the metal framework of it um I’ve just come on to the M5 no I've not yet no not yet I'm on my way onto it I'm just uh letting a van out in front of me yeah there's a sign there for a place called Aztec West and I don’t know what that is and there's lots of office buildings and stuff to my left and wind uh wind turbines to the right um big office for EE uh big office for Yodel big office for oh I can't read that sign um big empty warehouse there with a giant open door and you can see all the way in and it was completely empty um not too many cars hopefully uh I am on the M5 now hopefully there won’t be too much traffic maybe I'll get through Bristol before it gets its too its worst but I think the M5 between Bristol and Exeter is the absolute worst it gets really so I'm not looking forward to that um at all I think if all goes to plan I'll break again at Exeter um I think in between each new recording I will maybe put some pictures do some I've done a lot of photography recently of service stations and um like roads stuff at night night videoing of ro of driving and stuff like that so I'm feeling a lot better again about the way this is going um it is really important to finish it I can see now the ocean to my right or not the ocean but I think the water that divides Bristol between Wales I might be completely wrong about this I have no idea but there’s a big patch of water there’s some chimneys and smokestacks and what looks like kind of harbour-ish kind of industrial areas um I'll be passing over the big bridge soon with the giant car parks of uh for the airports for the airport singular I should say if I was still with um {…} I would probably oh no I would get the um plane from Exeter to Norfolk and do that I have done that before didn't I did I do that when I visited her yeah I did I don't have to do that anymore so I am travelling a lot less but when I do I travel a lot um like this this it is a deceivingly long journey never quite realise how long it is until I'm doing it again this is something else I always wonder when I’m driving on motorways the way how many people are getting road head right now like like at least one person surely it does happen maybe not on motorways though I don’t know too dangerous I suppose Bristol airport is 17 miles ok I really underestimated how close I was everything is so far away it’s even worse in America everything is just so far away from everything else at least once you're in like a city in the UK you can walk everywhere pretty much but like there are pavements and shit and in America it’s just designed for cars like terrible I like the way the lamp posts as they get closer together become almost one line one colour one shape one form curving round the corner ahead of me like behind the trees that I can't see and then as you get closer they spread out and become consistent rhythmical movement in the corner of your eye to help you get a grasp on um motion I can see cranes and massive structures and wind turbines again in uh over to the right um there's a sign here saying that there’s congestion up ahead so there might be a standstill soon for a little while and cars on the right going in the opposite direction wide spread out which would indicate that they've just come out of an area of like um gridlock and that wouldn’t be good I hope that I manage to get everything done for college and outside of college for work and stuff I don't wanna get too emotional again but I just like yeah I just really hope that it works out there was a football pitch to my left there I could just see the goal looks like a football couple football pitches and maybe a clubhouse building um there’s the turning off for the airport so uh it hasn’t been 17 miles but it might have been a few at least lots of cones around now I don't um might be works coming up or something when I look at cones I think about that scene in Toy Story 2 where they’re hiding under the cones like crossing the road I don't know but that water tastes really weird and gross kinda metallic it’s a bit odd I just pulled out in front of a car that was going way too fast and wasn't moving over fast enough and it is some like preppy bullshit looking guy in a really smooth car um there’s um oh yeah here I am coming up to cross the um big bridge I believe now there’s a lot of anticipation there’s some flashing lights and the cars on the left have slowed down and then as you’re going up it feels like you’re going up in the build up to a drop in a rollercoaster and there’s big pylons and cranes and big skyscrapers that you can see and as you go up higher it reveals more of the landscape at the side and you going up and up and up and I'm reaching the top now I'm reaching the top I can see out I can see out over there’s a big river there’s water there’s there’s cranes there’s giant smokestacks there's big buildings there's mudflats there's like boats shored on the side of this river it must be low tide water’s all the way down there's a sea of an ocean of cars all glittering in the sun right now all reflecting light off their roofs um there’s a loads and loads of houses to my left there's a church there’s a church there’s trees there’s evergreen trees there’s trees without leaves there’s trees growing new leaves there's lamp posts there’s another services coming up there's more more cars on the right more cars so many cars it’s like a it’s it’s it’s a mosaic it’s like it’s water the the shape the curves and rises and falls of the car roofs are like the crests of waves rising and falling and as I'm moving past them it’s like the water has motion and they've gone now um and I’m off the bridge and there’s graffiti on my left there's more fences there’s more trees with white blossom and buds um I'm past this services this was big queue coming off to those services I'm I'm happy that I'm through bris I'm out on the other side now and it still doesn’t seem too busy I don’t know um what time it'll be getting busy maybe around when I hit Exeter it’ll be at its worse I imagine there’ll be at some point oh there's another church here um old looking church made of bricks not not big stones um faded there's a rugby pitch rugby posts and um maybe a dog walker I think in a little field by some houses and then I can't see anything again now the trees have taken over again um blocked it all out there's more fields going up a hill there’s um there's a horse I can see more more rugby pitches more rugby goal posts and a rugby kind of clubhouse there's some adverts on the side of the field so I guess people actually watch this game or something maybe seems weird to me that you would buy ad space on like a local rugby pitch um newly ploughed field with kind of orangey red um clay mud that looks kinda like clay there’s some sheep on this field here up this hill pulling over to the left again getting too excited going over that bridge I just wanted to get everything say everything I could see all at once um the strange shaped bridge up here looks like kind of maybe a part of a bike or a bone a wishbone perhaps um bridges kind of looking like ribs almost coming out of the side of the the landscape the holding close the road holding the road close to the surface of the skin of the of the of the earth um I'm s I really am surprised there's not that many cars um there's a convertible there with a kind of fashionable looking old woman driving it there's a white car and there's a grey car a black car and a red car and a another blue car and a silver two more silver cars behind me white white silver um I'm coming up now to the part where the road curves around and along the mountainside and drops away um feels like driving through scenic routes in um mountainous Europe or um something you would see in a film and I can see down to the road with the traffic coming in the other direction below below and I can see all the way across this giant what looks like a bowl when when there are hills on all sides then in the middle is like a bowl I can see houses and fields and um the it's just it's a steep drop past the past the fence but the fence looks sturdy enough to withstand a crash I imagine so I don't imagine people would have fallen down *cough* um and now as as I'm going uphill and the hill drops further down to the side it’s just off the side it’s just sky in front and then really faded foggy hills and trees to the right uh leafless uh fingery uh spooky trees to my left uh curving back round now the side of this hill is rocky dark rocks there’s a there’s a sign here warning about the slope of the road and the rocks have moss and plants growing out of it at an angle but it’s very steep um steeper even still on the other on the right now the the the road to the right is dropping down further away it’s very steep and it looks like we’re coming back down and I can see in the distance an ocean like not not the not ocean big stretch of water though big flat water and two two colossal poles um with wires connecting them down to the to the ground and posts on my left and cones and steps and more grass growing out of what just growing out of the road it looks like there’s a sign up coming up on my left it says Noah’s Ark Zoo Farm and I've  always wanted to go there and to my left as well there is a strange designed building which looks kinda like a mine a mine shaft chimney but then also a little bit like eastern eastern european architecture or middle eastern architecture as well to it which is I don't know what that building is that’s strange actually not seen that before there’s a tree that I just passed that the branches are really bending and curving and twisting and interlocking in a really ornate way it looks like an old engraving etching or illustration out of an old fantasy book I can see a a church spire in the distance and there’s some more sheep including some brown sheep a dark brown sheep which is that a thing I thought it was just white sheep or black sheep I don't know oh and there’s more fences with barbed wire again what are they keeping out there’s there’s so many ways around them out here and there’s nothing to protect more bushes flowering in white um white flowers and buds and bl um blooming a jogger is crossing the bridge up ahead looks like they might be on the phone giant empty barn with the doors missing and windows missing nothing inside it tall big um old old house there um made of stone um it looks enclosed and hidden away I I'm it’s how I imagine the house in House of Leaves to look although I haven't read enough of that to say whether that’s true or not yet I need to read more of that when I get get back to Plymouth um really very big tree with a giant span there looks like a like brain shaped almost and there’s cows some black cows and a couple white cows to the left couple brown cows couple sheep on the right more more cows on the left uh really farm farm heavy area more pylons and connecting wires and everything is flattened out now there’s no more hills it’s just flat flat stretch everywhere I'm going about 73 my petrol tank appears to be full it’s 14.5 degrees I'm in fifth gear just haha just a little update I'm feeling a lot better I think I'm there’s lots of chopped down trees and Jenga stacks of logs and uh big greenhouses empty greenhouses um white metal structure with glass um the van behind me is really close up behind but they could overtake if they wanted I don't know what they're doing there’s some gates in this field but they're not connected to fences they're just gates connecting nothing so I don’t perhaps they used to be fences but they've worn away just gonna have some more water again the um the sky is there are some thicker clouds patches of thicker clouds but mostly it’s very thin clouds there’s there’s soft overlapping gradients going from dark to light then back to dark then back to light again then back to dark and then patches of fluffy darker clouds um it’s somewhere between blue and grey and then yellow and grey and it’s lighting all of the surrounding fields with quite grey light again um quite grey green stronger green perhaps than it has been before though especially on the right actually it’s almost a bluish green um uh a wet green I would say and I can see in the field in the left some little flowers and some daffodils I saw there and a rusting metal container with some wood in it white farmhouse over there with a tiled roof really not a fan of the van behind me is behaving um really rude ok they’ve they’ve pulled away now but now they’re just in a slower lane I don't know what the deal is there um looks like all the cars are slowing down perhaps we’re hitting a patch of traffic I'm not sure a lot of sheep on the left again I can see the sun now in my peripheral vision on the right um so the sun is definitely on its way down its not too far down though um lots of houses on the right and a few trees a more residential area there are a couple of bridges coming up ahead with lots of cars on them and I just overtook and Argos lorry and coming up there’s a lorry with a big tank a cylindrical tank on the back white cars overtaken me two black cars a blue car behind me a white car a green car a black car a grey car a white lorry uh blue red black black silver silver silver grey silver white white white white silver uh red grey um the green car behind me is coming up close there’s some big farm buildings with piles of chopped wood and rubble and rocks and signs for more services on the left  and in a few miles I'm doing ok though I don't know if I need a break yet I think maybe I was just hungry um I had a I had a snack and stuff and I think that might’ve done the trick I don't know the the cars have the traffic has thinned out again I think people were just coming off on that junction um can get up to quite a speed here there’s not many cars around anymore um there’s a black van coming up behind though uh quite fast and on the right actually I just saw a stripy car which you don't often see there’s a um red brick church on the right um reminds me of the churches that they built in colonised in like a New England in America in the 18 hundreds that kind of architecture that exists in America that’s like very rapid and a few cream orangey coloured office warehouse buildings to the left there and now some more hills going down again into like a valley with hills all around it looks like hills with a brown and orange patches of grass and bushes autumnal looking wintery spring hasn't reached this area yet I've just pulled into the left lane um really empty roads really empty roads the the crest of that hill to the left looks like um if it was a lot thinner it would look like a tooth it reminds me of the golden fang building in Inherent Vice um saw a white a big white bird circling around above maybe a seagull I don't know some yellow trees um and a yellow field with some birds sitting in it a flock of birds sitting in that field sign says that I'm now entering Somerset the sky is even less uh patchy and more continual gradients with some stripes of darkness and matching the direction and lines of the wires overhead there just past on the right um was a lorry holding chickens I believe which always makes me feel really sad um and just there to the left were a few disused abandoned run down buildings made of wood look like they were falling apart maybe part of an old farm some more bridges crossing over here and the sign says the river axe which um and I'm just passing on my left the van that has a crane attached to the back maybe not attached maybe it’s carrying it I'll be interested to see how away Exeter is on the next sign whenever I see that the way the fences move and change in your peripheral vision and in front of your eyesight when you're on the road um is like a zoetrope where slow moving you see the individual lines and sections but then moving fast it blurs into one and the image behind becomes the focus when things move so quickly that you only notice what’s behind them and when they’re slowly they cover up and become opaque and I think that’s a really interesting phenomena I don't know if there’s any must just be to do with the frame rate of the human eyesight because I know that when you film when you video fences moving like that they look almost like they’re moving backwards and at different speeds and stuff because of the frame rate of the image *cough* and in fact the fences moving is almost like a film stock moving through a camera with each partition being like a frame um the field on my left is freshly ploughed and has a puddles big puddles of water sitting in it very flat flooded um to my right a farm building has a flag flying I don't know what the flag is though I can't make it out from here oh no it’s a union jack ok did I talk about flags earlier I think I did it’s been a while though haha I'm looking forward to driving past the um the beach seaside sections where all the boats are and stuff past Exeter on the along the coast of Devon but there is a really nice a really big hill to my right now and a trailer to my left like a a wagon to my left in a field just on its own in the middle of a field like abandoned there’s a lorry here carrying logs and they look like they’ve yeah they have been sanded down and chopped and perhaps varnished they all had the same colour to them they looked a bit shiny as if they had been varnished um my throat is starting to hurt again but I'm not panicking I feel like I'm becoming much more lucid actually no the opposite of lucid uh Exeter is 49 miles away apparently the opposite of lucid because um lucid is when you’re aware of something I think a awareness and becoming more like fluid and less lucid perhaps there’s a lot of sheep and sheep dotted around the field on the left there 49 miles is a lot longer than I thought there for Exeter but I'm doing ok I'm just gonna check to see if it’s still recording uh yeah I've been going for 50 minutes it seems I really haha I really have no idea if I'll be able to hear any of what I'm saying right now IF I SHOUT does it appear yeah it does appear a lot louder I probably I probably will be ok then wow the the the fog in the distance and the low hanging clouds making that hill range in the distance basically white against the sky and some yellow light is coming through cracks now and the sky is kind of separate from thickness of cloud in a zig zag shape and a golden yellow shining through above those wires and houses and trees I think that the times I stop I'll have like a service station divider uh coloured pages perhaps which says like service station break or something and make it a real kind of event like it feels like for me really beautiful sky over to the right I can't describe I can't I've done my best I suppose its it’s not changed it’s just passing another river now there’s a lot of bodies of water that I don't really notice before um lots of patches of dead grass in that field over there um big clumpy patches of ground and orange and sepia tones and pale brown and uh the oh look there’s more solar panels there behind a fence um past that field and sheep on the right gates and an orange recovery van to the left and a pale duck egg blue cream colour car but its an old car it’s not a new car then there was a strange purple blue colour car a faded blue grey car a bright blue a fading black covered in mud a muddy white car a muddy silver car then there’s that clean shiny green car that was up behind me earlier I recognise that one and there's some horses wearing coats haha over there to the left and some birds flying to the right and uh big what looked like a well to the left I don’t know if that was a well it would be cool if that was a well though um my throat is really sore now really hurting the roof of my mouth as well and um a coach crossing the bridge up ahead and I could see the silhouettes of all of the profiles of the people inside it because of the way the light was falling that was really weird I could see each individual person and there was another river just there with reeds and uh brown grass growing on the banks and giant massive Morrisons warehouses to my right with loads of vans and lorries all outside and there looks like they’re building more more warehouses I can see more framework over there um there’s some lorries without trailers just the cabs some with cabs uh and then that’s opposite sheep and there’s a there's a orange windsock on top of the Morrisons warehouse and that seems weird to me why would they need to know about the wind is it for the uh oh look there's um there’s that weird wicker statue of of like a strange looking figure walking and it’s like it’s trying to be the angel of the north but it’s really not um yeah I'm I'm really I'm very surprised at how empty this road is still um still not many cars on it a warehouse there to the left that’s mostly black with red red uh structure lines on the edges and corners uh just absolutely no cars at all I'm uh I'm going 80 comfortably and so are all the cars around me it seems there’s some cows in that field one of them’s sitting down but not for rain I don't think I just think for like for chill oh there’s a bunch over there there’s brown black and white cows with black spots um and another ploughed field with water resting in ditches and puddles um all over flooded um and trees thick thick trunked trees with dark grey dark green leaves uh growing on it and more uh vast greenhouses to my right with domed domed plastic roofs and then also triangular glass roofs and shipping containers and solar panels sign up ahead uh pointing off to a place called mine head which is funny uh to me uh coming up over going over a bridge now with the levels of the wires and the pylons could look down just then into a there’s a a river um obviously what the bridge is crossing and there’s houses with conservatories big warehouses and buildings with connecting pipes and tubes I think they’re for Argos there’s um a B&B down on the left um a yellow building with a brown roof and they’ve painted white on the roof saying B&B 24 hour um must just be a home business I mean obviously it’s a B&B what am I talking about but the it the looks almost like an aeroplane landing strip or something the way they’ve painted on the roof there was a dead badger just there at the side of the road it always strikes me with badgers how big they are and how muddy they always are I don't know if that’s just the way they get when they get killed but you imagine a badger to be black and white but they're always like black and yellow like yellow brown dirty fur um I suppose like my dog gets when she’s all like grimy she gets all yellowy brown so it makes sense I suppose they do like don’t get cleaned or anything just live outside um it was safely at the side of the road though so it wasn’t gonna get a continually get hit which is nice always feel really bad obviously it’s bad with whatever happens when an animal dies I always feel worse when they get hit again and again when they’re already dead and there’s a services coming up in 10 miles and I don't know whether or not to go uh I don't I could do with a break I think maybe just a rest um I don't know if that’s good good idea for time though I think probably it is it doesn't take that long from Exeter so maybe the best thing to do um I can't remember how far away Exeter was 30 miles maybe I should wait till I get a bit closer closer to Exeter I mean that’s definitely a farm a farm house oh wow that field on the left was like very red very uh red soil and orange red soil very fertile I imagine I don't know um more graffiti under that bridge again how how I'm repeating myself a lot but I think I feel that’s almost the way of these things and part of the point of this is to document how often these things happen ok coming up on the left is another field with what looks like white soil I don't know what that is is it plastic sheeting yeah it oh ok it was it’s black plastic sheeting reflecting the light uh covering up the seeds I imagine to stop birds eating it there was another dead badger I really got a good look at that one that was sad I guess they live around here eating the crops and shit I don't know what I don't know what badgers eat really there’s some more solar panels in that field more fields more fields another bridge more fields fading into white with the with the distance and the clouds there more white brown green pale colours leaves a lot more leaves coming in on these trees around here I'm noticing but still a lot of trees without leaves as well still haven't escaped winter yet there’s another red orange soil uh field perhaps maybe it’s a type of soil that they sprinkle or fertiliser or something I don't know there’s a car with a horse box uh just coming up here on the on the left can’t tell if there’s a horse inside or not though there was no window at the back sun is sun is really breaking through the clouds on the right um the area of clouds around it is so so bright and so white that it really stands out amongst the other grey and there’s a patch of daffodils there on the left and more concrete overhead on the overhead bridge more power boxes to the side with little steps going up to them for the rad for the uh motorway workers to access ramps and uh fences with ivy growing over and barbed wire I guess that’s to keep animals out I understand that one uh yellow temporary sign blue sign brown sign with tourist destinations old brick houses with crooked roofs next to new sports club houses and old old stone church um crossing another river here more greenhouses on the left um more these ones are glass with triangular roofs again not like the curved plastic ones a strange um what must be a wind turbine but not a traditional windmill looking one one that spirals round like um looks like ribbons circling round a post um maybe it’s not a wind turbine maybe it’s a wind speed measurer or something like that I'm not sure there’s only one of it whatever it is another dead badger um again with a really large patch of blood smeared um there was a dead bird I think or a rat or something ok and another one there’s a lot of dead animals here really big patch of blood and there was some crows pecking at it pecking at the ground around it um a field of yellow coming up on the left and a field with old wooden fences protecting a small area of trees and some hay bales wrapped in black plastic yeah more yellow flowers on the left probably rapeseed again I think *cough* there was something attached to a fence up there on that bridge and I c I couldn't tell what it was um perhaps missing clothes attached with locks to the to the fence for no other reason than there’s nothing else to do with it I'm not sure the van in front of me is producing a lot of emissions like dark grey smoggy bullshit coming out of its exhaust um so I'm keeping my distance a bit I don't wanna yeah I'm gonna try and overtake it I don't wanna get be inhaling all that um the it it is I think it is to do with when stuff when it’s going wrong that it does that that’s not sort of normal yeah it’s really producing a lot it should get that checked out there’s a more fields with yellow flowers on the right um more trees on the left a weird oh wait no that was just part of a lorry lorry with a big pole sticking out the top of it cream colour fabric backed trailer here for a feeding tomorrow’s farmers today it says haha that’s a very specific slogan uh going down a hill now towards a curve and a big curved bridge coming up over head and a a a tree over there to the right um with very spherical bird nests or patches of leaves or something looks like something in straight out of a Dr Seuss book or something there’s a digger in by this field up ahead for this farm uh and massive machine combine harvester looking machine there uh Taunton services coming up here and driving right into the path of the sun right now the sky is all black no not black grey it’s all grey it’s all one colour of grey apart from the patch of clouds around by the sun which are more pale white and yellow but it’s getting greyer and greyer um I think the Music for 18 Musicians just ended and we’re onto the next piece which means I've  been going for about an hour uh on this run I know I will stop at Exeter I won’t stop before I've  decided really big building to the right big kind of manor house looking building I wonder if it’s maybe been converted to be a *cough* I know in Norfolk there was a big manor house converted to become a mental hospital lots of sheep again on the left I'm starting to feel a bit weird again a bit kind of queasy and my throat is very very sore so I am hoping that I come up to Exeter soon I can’t be too far I've  been making good time I don’t really know what to say anymore I'm finding it difficult finding it really difficult it just all looks the same haha it all looks the same so I can't describe that and I'm feeling just tired and I've got so into this that I'm used to it now I'm just I just looked to myself in the mirror and I can see my mouth moving as I'm talking and that is actually really weird I just smiled as I said that and I really really hate my new hair man this sucks I wish id kept it long I'm gonna grow it out definitely oh my god Exeter is 25 miles away that is still a long way it feels like um this is a long trip isn’t it feel almost like I'm talking to somebody I guess I'm talking to you the future reader of this thing um oh look there was a sheep lying down looking really chill um aw and there was little baby sheep it also looked like an arctic fox that was very weird services are 23 miles that’s where I'll take my next break excellent lots of telegraph poles there connecting up wires above those farmhouse buildings barns I think and small barns uh lots of plastic bags all in one tree over there maybe they couldn't stick other ones but then gravitated towards one tree there if the theory of gravity is that all objects connect and attract each other to each other I’ve always wondered if similar objects attracted similar objects I don't know if because I know that there is a scientific example uh the explanation sorry for water tension but I always wondered if that was maybe a side effect of gravity um just lots of farm buildings around here it seems yeah lots and lots on both sides both sides there’s just farms and sheep more sheep really empty road um it’s that kind of grey colour that’s almost pink pinky grey road uh you can see the markings where the tires go and where where most people drive I guess and and worn and worn down there were some elm trees there with like white and grey black bark patches I just passed a black van on my left there was a tire and some purple blue flowers on the centre bank to the right oh look here I am I'm coming up to Devon now sign coming up to Devon um big like weird green post with some panels at the top of it there don't know what that is it’s getting darker the sky is getting more grey there are no birds um not really much around at all fewer pylons than before more bushes with yellow orange flowers on them I don't I'll have a look at what those bushes are later and no leaves at all on any of these trees apart from that one there it’s all brown um so brown that it’s blocking out the green from the fields behind the trees there’s two birds now flying overhead black birds or I don't know what kind of birds but they are black um that’s what I mean fields of gently divided around here not so harshly divided with strict hedge lines and fences more flowing as one at least on the left on the right they're still connected up and also differentiated in slight shades of greens and yellows and browns a dirt track there going up a a hill to the left with some open metal gates and little yellow white poles with blue and red tape um an overhead electric sign that is dull and empty more yellow flowers and um another dead badger on the on the left seen a lot of those recently um I'm feeling much more relaxed about this and less freaked out um I'm I am gonna be embarrassed looking back I think but that was so weird that was so weird what a weird thing to happen it must have been the coffee it must have just like spun me out um I am nervous about arriving back in Plymouth oh look there’s a train there’s a train coming out to the right a passenger train not a cargo train uh a blue one um I'm worried about being back in Plymouth I'm worried about being alone again and f uh like looking fending for myself again I've  I really miss the comforts of home and the the comforts of home have been really nice and refreshing and recharging but not enough that I feel like I'm back at 100% I feel like I'm at 50 or 40 even 60 I don't know but I don't feel ready to be in that environment again to be back on my own and I I ah there’s too much happening at the moment and I don't just don't I just don't wanna do it sometimes I don't know the grass in the middle parting here has white flowers that it looks almost like uh dew drops or snow or frost the way it um looks in the distance and as it’s getting closer it’s 12.5 degrees now so it’s getting a bit colder but it’s still not too cold um and I'm actually a quite nice temperature in here now when the sun was shining in it was getting really hot um sweaty there’s a massive two two giant domes over to the right with a white dome I don't know what they are maybe um I know that those dome type buildings are often used for spy surveillance espionage stuff there's one like that in norfolk maybe that’s what that is I don't know always made me think of like observatories and stuff like that maybe I should hand write this out that might be really nice actually or I have been looking at trying to make a font of my handwriting and I know that you can do that I'll have to try out different fonts and stuff and see what look works best it might feel nice for the if I'm having a picture of a the waveform of the audio to contrast that with the kind of human-ness of speech by using handwritten text or typewriter text or I could type it out on a typewriter or there’s a chimney stack over there to the left and some sheep again and people seem to be switching their headlights on now but it’s not that dark this is uh presuming that I can presuming that I can hear everything anyway haha I think someone ahead just flipped me off well they pulled out in front of me so I don't know what they want me to do silver car not even I don't know they were just being a bit like just I I flashed my light I just thought that was the right thing to do I don't know the roads are really curving around now lots of hills again um trees green trees the ivy around the trees is green making the trunk look green there was a load of tape or something stuck up in that tree and it smells suddenly like manure and that bridge was made of bricks and yeah it smells a lot like manure all of a sudden hopefully not me must be from the farms I just I don't know what to say anymore I don't know what to say I just want a break again more hay bales wrapped in black and green plastic this time um looks like everyones slowing right down up there more more traffic around but still not still not much like I really thought there'd be a lot more um I can't believe I've gone through Bristol without slowing to a stop really fortunate police only section there a road going off to the left little secret Disneyland passageways around for the police to like y’know the motorway police or whatever some a a tree over there with orange autumn leaves that are look like drying crisping up I wonder if it got tricked by all that snow recently um to thinking it was coming up to oh look there’s a go kart track on the left no uh quad bike track quad world I wonder when I’ll be passing that aviation museum I know there’s one of those nearby as well can’t wait to get into bed after a drive have a have a brownie there’s a tree with leaves on the top right tip top of a hill over there that looks really picturesque like that tree in Shawshank Redemption if I'm remembering right I haven't seen that film in a while but just one of this kind of trees on a hill that doesn't really exist that’s only in pictures of films or something I might be catching up with the flip off car I don't know um I don't want them to think I'm angry but they're going faster than me so I don't think I will catch up there was a white renault car there that had {…}’s name and it’s kinda spun me out again but I'm not gonna fall back into that uh thing again I hope it is getting darker again the sun is really thick behind its clouds now and the whole surroundings are getting darker there’s a lone horse in that field over there wearing a coat dark brown horse just like chilling eating grass but it’s completely on its own and I dunno it’s just like how I feel right now as well I guess haha um there’s a lot of there’s more pylons and stuff in the distance bigger ones big ones telegraph poles um thick wires overhead fences with ivy on more orange yellow bushes more paths hills tiredness can kill take a break an empty temp either abandoned or blown out barn with rusting support beams and no walls or roof just the beams um I don't know why there are so many of those so many barns abandoned so many areas abandoned so many buildings not lived in there’s a paintball park haha to the right that I've never seen before um looks like it’s in an old mine building or something um perhaps there’s two joggers in neon fluorescent uh shirts running over a bridge ahead um over ahead there’s a sign up here for Exeter airport so I'm definitely coming in to Exeter which is good news um there’s a slate grey mini overtaking me on the right and there’s a big uh new housing development being built on the right it seems and a lot of building works being done on the left as well like a new looking road covered in dust in orange brown dirt and and mud and yellow diggers and new brick houses with skylights and grey roofs and a big blue bridge arching over with a s suspending wires um holding it up up ahead and a big modern um trapezium shape building with giant glass windows um I don't know what that is but it’s some kind of I don't know I don't know what that could be a oh might be a part of the airport but I thought the airport was further away it could be the airport airports do look like that um sign for the park and ride sign for a science park maybe it’s a science park science research centre or something that makes sense more modern buildings on the right here we are coming up to Exeter services I have to do a tricky manoeuvre here to pull over in time um I don't know ah fuck I don't know if I'm gonna be able to I'm gonna have to overtake and pull across ok that was quite scary haha I managed to do it though and I'm pulling off at the services and I'm gonna have another break I'm not getting a coffee though absolutely not I will probably get more carb-based snacks to keep my energy going haha going again um I can't remember what food they have here have to get into this lane to go round the roundabout I wonder if it this lane service station up ahead there’s a um caravan caravan show room with lots of caravans for sale and a sign at the side of the road here looks really old for a circus perhaps and a orange brick buildings with orange roofs and there are some bikers and a uh bridge to my right it’s weird being stationary again and describing from stop flattened cans weeds specks of stones and plastic and mud and gravel and sticks and red lights turning amber turning green um green lights again I'm going under the bridge now I'm pulling over here to the difficult roundabout um s ton stands for service station it seems yeah so I'm going forward up here and then turning right around this roundabout this is a difficult one um I remember this roundabout being tricky from the other times I've stopped here but at least it’s not too busy and I'm managing to get around it with ease um go right here right round to the station to the services could really go for a beer when I get home nearly crashed just then someone was really coming up behind me without really looking um Exeter services are really big all down a hill it’s really empty there’s really no one travelling on the roads at the moment which is nice um means I can park right down close to it it’s weird I would’ve expected more people nice to be to not have to walk all the way down and up the hill there’s a family there wearing pyjamas they must’ve been driving for a while or maybe they've only started but they're gonna be driving for a while ok I've parked and I'm stopping the recording again
