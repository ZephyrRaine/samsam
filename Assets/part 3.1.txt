ok im starting the recording of part 3 and I'm *cough* I took a while and I'm feeling a bit better but I'm going to be more careful this time and if I'm not feeling ok again I'm gonna stop because I don't wanna die for this really shit bullshit piece of performance or whatever the fuck this is itâ€™s shit so I'm gonna take it a bit more casually and a bit more slowly and just get through it and take more breaks I think is important as well but I do think this is something I should finish I don't think there's any point in stopping half way throug
