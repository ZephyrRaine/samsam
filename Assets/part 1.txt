Alright testing can you hear me can you hear me from this distance just about I should probably be loud ok its the 16th of april 2018 um I am in my in my car a white VW up um it’s just gone 2 o'clock and I'm gonna be driving from Redbourn my house in Redbourn to Plymouth where I live in term time I do this drive every few weeks and I'm gonna be talking the whole way it will take around 6 hours um I won’t be talking when I'm taking breaks at service stations I’ll only be talking when I'm inside the car and when the engine is running I hope that it doesn't stop recording and I hope that it hears me over the sound of my car I um I'm leaving now just reversing out of my drive my aim here I guess is to pay closer attention to all the details of the drive that I don't normally think about um to think more carefully about how long it takes how much thought and time spent thinking I can fit into this journey um and to create a 6 hour long stream of consciousness I guess these roads I'm driving right just outside my house I've driven hundreds and hundreds of times um they're very it’s a very suburban area lots of houses and cars there was a woman just walking a big dog I don't know what kind of dog that was um the route I'm taking I'm getting on the M1 and going towards the M25 and then after that I will take the M4 I think another part of this project is that I'm not using um my phone for satnav which I guess I do rely on and even though I think I know the way and so I guess this is also a test of memory and a test of focus because I'll be both driving carefully of course and haha talking constantly and thinking of things to say I'll try and describe my feelings and everything I see and the route and things it reminds me of and I'll try and make this somewhat literary I suppose but I don't know how easy that'll be kinda improvising improvising detailed and literary descriptions of things the weather today is overcast I would say the clouds are mostly one colour but there are highlights and shadows where the edges round off into each other and there is no sign of the sky at all it’s not dark though it’s still sunny and it doesn’t look as though it will rain but it often does on this trip at certain points but that could happen the um although it’s been a couple of months into spring the trees around are mostly still leafless or they are budding the colours are mostly browns and oranges but there are specks of green here and there the even the grass has got a kind of brown sticky kind of look to it scratchy almost I'm thinking of when bob ross makes sticks and things in bushes and scrapes away the paint that’s it feels the surroundings around here one of the road signs just then was covered in moss and mildew and was kind of although white was becoming green as well everything is blurring into these desaturated pastelley colours apart from a bush just there actually that has red leaves on it I don't know if they’re real or not if they that bush is outside of a newly developing housing estate and so it’s possible that it’s fake which is that’s weird isn’t it that’s weird to think that that’s even a thing that happens um I'm just noticing as well there are flags up by the side of this field I think is the hertfordshire show ground there are flags and they are white and blue striped wavy striped with a little yellow shield and a sitting down deer in it I don't know what that is it must be the flag of hertfordshire I didn't know are flags still important were flags I guess flags were made when were made for the purpose of identifying ships and what country ships belong to or you would hold a flag during battle so I don't know if it must just be tradition for now well suppose you use flags for sporting events and thinks like that don't you flags have a lot of different purposes ok I'm coming around onto the M1 now I'm um it’s quite busy already and there's lots of lorries around in the left lane so it might be difficult to come out um but it looks as though there's a opening I have to wait for this lorry here ok I've come on the all motorways I feel like look the same and so the descriptions are gonna be quite similar I think from now there's grassy banks and little leafless small trees um from halfway to the top of the banks and on the left hand side there are pylons with connecting wires and a fence there are low metal fences to my left and concrete barricades to the right and lampposts in the centre the um the lorry in front is big and maroon with a white white stripe across it says Downton delivers why does it say Downton delivers wouldn't it be deliveries or movers or I don't know I've moved into the second lane and I've overtaken the lorry and behind me there is a coach um what looks like a taxi a private taxi just overtook me um coming up on my left there is a green Eddie Stobart van lorry and on the right there is a mini van one of those kinda suburban mini vans for like shipping a load of kids around there's a pylon to the left thats connecting over the road connecting down to the right and on my right slowly I'm there's a silver car with a woman and what looks like her husband in it she's driving and he looks kind of relaxed and they've gone past now there's a orange SOS on one of those phone phone symbol uh not phone emergency phone signs I guess to show where to go ok so the coach is overtaking me now it’s going towards heathrow airport and I've just gone over one of those little lines that show you there's a speed camera in use but I'm only going 60 though so I should be fine I'm just passing another truck it’s got a kind of vintage look to it it says established 1960 on it so I guess that’s what they're going for quite kinda a colourful design ok so the hill on the left has subsided now and lowered and its a flat plain a plain it goes into a wooden fence and behind that there's a newly ploughed field but not that new the ground has dried in the sun and lightened in colour and now the fields are grass and now they're ploughed again and this field looks like it has some kind of hay or straw on it perhaps some kind of fertile ground or maybe they'll be having pigs or something on it I know they do around here ok now the surroundings are dropping down and I can see a bit further on and there's pylons pylons going off into the distance um left and right not laid out straight curving round some area they're going across fields and on my right in the distance I can see a large cream coloured building with big windows and some yeah more industrial buildings warehouse and water containment maybe purifying units its weird how quickly it’s interesting  I should say its gone from a suburban environment with houses residential to farmland and industrial areas like almost instantly on this road we’re transferred into this new situation and I always think about this when im driving motorways there must be so much land just like everywhere because we’re just cutting through this space in essentially what is one of the quickest ways possible and there's there's stuff everywhere there's stuff everywhere and things that you don't normally see or think about or consider and they all exist um outside of the areas you normally live I don't know if there's a ok so I'm realising I'm going quite slow and I should probably speed up a bit because I don't want to take forever but I don't know it is very busy on this road today there's a lorry sports direct to my left and in front a waste management van and a sign that says do not undertake and I thought that said do not overtake to start with but I am overtaking it now I'm really worried already that I'm not gonna find enough things to talk about and I think that this I happening already and I'm scared because it’s only been about 5 minutes or something probably and I've gotta keep going until for like 6 hours there's some close up pylons on the left here and a wood and a small cottage and I'm just thinking again like what what is that place where is that where am I I feel like I'm nowhere on this road but someone lives right next to it someone must be hearing it constantly hearing this road ok I'm coming onto the M25 now so I better get left I left that a bit late not concentrating as much as I should be um so I'm coming off onto the M25 and staying right so that I get onto the M4 the tree the little trees I guess you could call them shrubs I never use the word shrub because it feels almost fantasy but these ones have got more leaves on a nice light green and some pale pale whites and pale yellows and pale greens maybe blossom but the trees the larger trees have no leaves and you can see each branch clearly crisply defined like splitting and separating uh like little fractals um getting so small that I can’t see them and now coming down curving round onto this connecting road I'm going underneath two overpass roads they feel colossal and I feel very small and I feel this in my little car I feel so small compared to the bigger vehicles and compared to these giant structures and there's something so strange and dystopian to me about big concrete overpasses like that they they feel like something that don't exist apart from in like Disneyland and weird areas of abandoned cities and oh there's an orange a deep orange rusty barrier on the side of the M25 now that I'm on holding the holding the side banks up and away from the road um and everything the road appears everything is weathered and old the paint feels quite the paint on the road the road markings and lines feel new but all of the structures themselves the infrastructure feels ancient and the concrete is old and speckly and dirty and the rain has permanent lines running down the side even the traffic cones that have just appeared on the left I don't know what they're for they look old as well they're faded the reflective tape has been torn and they're filthy on the bottom and the side is rusting and the pedestrian bridge over the top now feels old as well you would feel safe going across it because concrete is so sturdy but it it looks old and I'm thinking about it and you always they mustve I don't  know when all these roads were made because you don't really it’s quite a big deal when a new road was made and things like the M25 must’ve been around for ages and when did they decide to name these roads and because obviously I was on the M1 was that the first road they made is the M25 the 25th I don't know I should look that up when I get home I guess I'm going 70 now I'm noticing that my petrol is down to about a third and so I think regrettably I'm going to have to stop at a station sooner or later maybe when I get onto the M4 I mean there aren’t any on the M25 on this stretch at least I don't know how far away the M4 is it is being shown up on signs so I guess it’s not that far I think it’s before heathrow I used to I used to drive to heathrow when I picked up and dropped off {…} so there’s a I guess a painful-ish memory associated with this drive that feels familiar um to my left now there’s a car that must’ve been broken down on a tow truck um it’s one of those old vauxhalls its blue and I like I like the look of those cars but they’re not vintage in a kind of well-made vintage car way so I worry about driving one um {…} sent me a link to a gumtree listing of a car for a quid I don't I think it was in working condition so that’s weird it’s crazy how the prices of things fluctuate and change so much depending on where you're looking and what it is and the age and quality and nothing feels consistent everything feels changing and uncertain um the the big I'm not sure what to call them the big structures with the signs on them go over the all the way across the road there’s no attempt to ah I'm thinking about the there’s no attempt to hide what it is it’s a very simple minimalist scaffolding kind of look to it and the the y’know the bollards on the side they’re quite minimalist as well and um it’s all completely about the function of these things it’s not about the yeah and the fences there’s nothing they’re not trying to kid you about what they are or make them look nicer or more cleaner it’s just about function even the road signs how they’re such bright blue they’re actually I guess they’re colour coded as well aren’t they because the red signs are for new changing conditions or new and the blue ones are direction signs showing you where you are but then also that blue sign said authorised vehicles only which is a command so I'm not sure there's another kind of pylon looking tower to the right which I guess is a is not a pylon because it’s not connected to anything else it looks quite like the BT tower I've gone past it now I'm going down a hill and the hill the bank on the left is steeper and thicker with like bracken and on the right it’s not as steep and I can see *cough* I can see ahead trees evergreen trees that stand out from the trees that have lost their leaves I'm still seeing signs for the M4 so I don't have to come off yet um I saw just then unique from the other lamp posts a lamp post with a longer stick at the top and a bird was sitting on that um there’s a highway maintenance truck on my left now that I’m just passing all of the cars at the moment that I can see are greys muted grey blues whites slate greys that’s silver a bright red one just past now obviously my car is white there’s some black cars but they’re not deep black they’re black in a grey way the car just past has a temporary red and white number plate stuck over its existing one and I wonder why I don't know what that means um everything feels grey there's a quality to the light where it feels as though there's no light source and the clouds have diffused everything and patches of light are coming through but muffled and lighting everything in a kind of bleak melancholic like almost Sebald-esque tone it feels like it could rain um there's a green lorry with a green trailer but it’s absolutely filthy from exhaust fumes it looks like and really faded to a kind of black colour the lorry that I just passed has a shipping container on the back and not a traditional lorry trailer I haven't seen that before or maybe I have but I haven’t  noticed it um the rusting bank on the side now has small stones and pebbles beneath it and some of the bushes have yellow flowers um the bank is definitely man-made here there’s a big black netted astroturf perhaps material seeping into the sides um there's some road work signs I'm just passing now perhaps there will be a um a section where I have to drive slower where I have to go through cones the fields now are dropping away and a much yeah they’re dropping away and they’re deeper and they feel rolling and smooth and um someone must’ve broken down just then a van was pulled over and the hazard lights were flashing and someone was standing up on the bank perhaps looking for phone reception um there’s more pylons and more bridges crossing over and I'm wondering where these bridges go from or to because again it feels like I'm in the middle of nowhere it doesn’t feel like there's a purple pipe across the middle barrier and there’s two diggers and a temporary fence and lots of cones and what looks like a a bigger building work that I can’t see behind some trees maybe they’re building a new connecting road *cough* ok the sign’s telling me I’m now entering Buckinghamshire  there’s just there there was what looked like a clothesline with clothes pegs um maybe three or four stretches of wire long I wonder what that is I don’t know if that seems strange that tree is beautiful whoa the there’s a sign to my right that has sandbags holding it down I guess for wind and rain um there’s no fields to the left anymore it’s just bushes and trees again brown leafless pale cream blossom and budding leaves small yellow flowers and empty trees graceful and sharp I would call them splitting apart again you can see all of the connecting lines they look like veins or capillaries or the blood vessels in the lungs I guess that’s what they’re called y’know to make a metaphor out of it they are lungs for Earth on motorway you do feel very aware of the emissions that you're making by my petrol has gone down to a quarter now I really will have to find a stop soon as soon as there’s a petrol station I think I will go for it I will also like a coffee so I will wait for that the road coming off now is the M40 not the M4 so I'm gonna wait I'm just passing the big arching brick bridge it looks so old there’s ivy growing up over it that’s the one that says “give peas a chance” on it and I always wonder how they managed to get that going there's a big power station to the left it looks amazing all these wires and sci-fi looking contraptions and metal rods and poles and shapes and there’s some houses now but also like a I guess a fire station there’s one of those fire station practice towers those empty brick towers that they set on fire and time themselves climbing up *cough* I've  never seen that before um there’s there were just some electricity wires crossing over then and again now but I can’t see what they’re connecting to oh I can now there's more pylons I can see a plane taking off in the distance above what I guess is Heathrow big uh giant white cube buildings look like giant shipping containers big warehouse type buildings um a very fast car just overtook on the right I’m going 73 so there’s no real need um and coming up behind me is a car a blue car I just went under a tunnel that has bright white lights it must be quite new because it’s got that new design that new car lights have that are quite intimidating I find it’s overtaking me now let me see if I can get a look at who is driving it yeah it was a kind of pompous looking business boy um it’s not that *cough* not that new a car 2015 but it has that scary look there’s a dirty jeep that I'm coming up past with a tire on the back and that makes me laugh because when are you ever gonna replace a tire really on the right the traffic is a lot thicker um and I saw that a big car container was pulled over on the side so perhaps there was an issue I didn't notice it though but really hope that I don't miss my turn I'm quite far I'm in the third lane so it’ll take me a while to move over I might move into the second lane now just in case yeah I have done that now the left lane is full oh a lorry is just coming out in front of me that's annoying I'm gonna have to slow right down I think that that's sensible though because I think I might be coming up to the the exit there was just just there was a a stone wall um made from stones I'm not sure what kind of stones possibly flint or limestone contained within like a chicken wire mesh type thing those blocks kinda like the ones they have down by the sea to prevent erosion prevent the the high tides from wearing away the banks and the cliffs and the sand and there’s um some fields on the left divided by big tall tree lines and there’s a just some pylons and little telegraph poles there that are kind of almost diagonal in a in a really beautiful like rustic uh kind of way on the left I'm seeing there there’s either a lake or solar panel farm and I think that that is so hard to tell the difference between water and solar panels when you’re passing by they both have the same reflective but not fully reflection glass-like quality making the sky colour more pervasive I really don't know what whatever it was it’s not on the side anymore so I still don't know the lorry in front of me is going out further into the right really really going for it *cough* I don’t think that’s the most sensible thing but you’ve gotta be sympathetic because y’know lorry drivers live deadlines constantly and so I do understand that um i’d really like to get that game Eurotruck simulator i’d like to have something reliably meditative to do during times of stress that I don't have at the moment I decided not to bring {…}’s Xbox back to plymouth with me because I don’t want to distract myself from all my work coming up on the left um I believe is like a haha ok there’s a lentil advert I think it’s a a vehicle uh sales area they’re selling orange like cherry pickers and diggers oh actually maybe it’s a building site there’s lots of big containers and ladders and windows and what is this place and there’s the big old 80s looking building with a concrete front and brick sides and windows I just don’t know what there’s a sign saying for kew gardens and I would absolutely love to go to kew gardens one time I really think and yeah coming off onto the M4 now I'm going towards the west towards Slough and I’m not talking right now I’m trying to concentrate but I know I have to keep it up I really want this to be a long piece um because this is gonna be so difficult I'm nowhere near fucking just not close to finishing at all ok there’s a giant Royal Mail van um on my right and I’m I'm coming off right now and I'm staying right and I'm going down another one of these kind of windy spiral off roads  taking me down to the new road max speed 40 it says on that sign there’s a small little post with a security camera coming out of it it looks almost like an animal uh poking out of the ground um where is the building that is watching all of the footage from all of the cameras all around the motorways where is that building would it be in London would they have multiple ones for each road or the different locations I'm coming up to the connect onto the M4 now there’s a big I don't know what that is field white field there’s a white field to my left is that frost a type of fertiliser *cough* it’s not water but it’s completely white you can see patches of brown soil but it was all white on the surface on my right now there’s a Megabus I can't see anyone on it it’s too high up and too close to me and I also can’t see where it’s going it’s going towards Gloucester it says um I'm gonna try and undertake just because I don’t wanna be stuck by it for the whole way um yeah I have done and it’s pulled in behind me that's good um in the distance towards the right there are big what look like residential apartment block buildings with windows I think it's an apartment block it looks quite similar to where I lived in Southampton because office blocks have different kind of looks to them I think but it could be offices it feels almost like an alien world right now but maybe it is I think that it is offices there’s big very modern looking giant glass offices here I don’t know oh they must be apartments they’ve got curtains and stickers on the windows who lives here do they work at DHL that was a DHL office no no there are other there’s a Marriott hotel where am I I don't know I must be near London this must be an area where I don't know the fence coming up on the left is dark green um I'm not gonna pull into the left I think there are cars wanting to come across and the trees on the left have wooden fences around their bases and it makes it look almost like a park and the grass looks really well kept and on the left as well and there's a pedestrian foot bridge although it feels at once like the middle of nowhere it also feels like there could could be people near here that use this place to as a park I'm just passing through some smoke now I always find that smoke on motorways smells like smokey bacon crisps and sometimes my car makes that smell and I used to get paranoid that there was maybe like a dead animal stuck in my engine burning and that was what the smell but I don’t think that is what that is I think it's just perhaps engine coolant or um I don't know um I'm about 20 miles away from reading it says on that sign so I think I'm actually making ok time I don't think that sign had services on it though I really I'm still at a quarter on my petrol tank but I am still nervous about that the cars all around me right now are quite big four by fours there's a jeep there's a mitsubishi there's a van in front there's a big Toyota on the right and there's a bmw on the left and a quite a smart looking sports type car I can't tell what that is is that a Mitsubishi as well I think no that's a Mercedes and in front of that there's a lorry and I feel quite outclassed by these other cars in my little um oh there are horses up on the left there’s some horses um and that's a strange thing there’s always animals in fields by motorways but there's never any farmhouses so do are they semi-wild do the farmers come and look at them check up on them occasionally and leave them alone for most of the time I don’t know I guess you don’t really think about how many farms there are still what do people keep horses for maybe people are riding around here um I don’t know what to say I’m running out of things to talk about this is I don't know why im decided to do this this is such a fucking stupid idea it’s just gonna be I'm gonna ok what's gonna happen is im gonna commit to it and finish it and I'm gonna be exhausted and in a terrible mood I don't I’m not looking forward to getting back anyway driving this long distance is really shit and long and annoying and I'm making it more difficult for myself and then I'm gonna either its not gonna have recorded which will be the worst thing that could happen or I will it wont transfer pr those horses are just wild without a fence next to the road that was really unsafe and there’s a cone on top of a pole um but and then I'm gonna print it out no I'm gonna I bet it’s not even gonna get picked up by the dictation thing and I'll have to go through it by hand and that’ll take me absolutely ages and I'll be exhausted and in a terrible mood and it'll take weeks and I wont finish it in time or I'll get all of the text ready put it through the dictation thing and get all the text and it’ll be shit and boring and it is shit and boring I'm boring myself I'm not making like nothing I'm there's nothing interesting about this I don't know what I'm doing and at the same time even though all of this is emotionally raw I'm aware that I'm being I'm being recorded right now and that I'm in some ways hamming it up and making it more dramatic for the recording so so I'm like am I am I deliberately having this outburst this early on to make it more interesting I think I’m doing it to convince myself but it is also what I’m feeling there's not much to describe there's a plastic bag in that tree just there and I can't remember what it was that oh wait cars going too fast I can't get in what was it that {….} was saying about plastic bags in trees they do look like ghosts no that’s from Night in the Woods plastic bags are ghosts of supermarkets haunting everywhere else I think that's so nice there's a really massive pile of rubble to the left there and some some vans all parked up next to each other but parked up in a way in which they can't leave *cough* like they’re all blocking each other in so I don't know what’s going on there there’s so many fields there’s so many fields so much building work so many pylons so many lamp posts so many fences so many little boxes of oh I just passed a river and there were some reeds and so many little boxes of power like power boxes what do they even power the I guess they’re power centres for the lights I don’t know there was a bit of tape there some of that red and white caution tape just tied on to a tree like flapping in the wind what’s that for I don’t know what to talk about there’s another river there’s canal boats on it that’s really nice actually I really want a break already I don't know how long I've been going for I hope it’s still recording I can't check I dont wanna crash there was graffiti just there on *cough* oh there was graffiti just there on the side of a large pole and again we're in the middle of nowhere I don’t know how the people got to that pole to do that the trees are quite thick and have ivy growing all over them and it's all dark green and there's a lake on the right and more trees on the left and they’re very thick and dirty dirty trucks and small shiny cars and black fences with ivy coming down the sides and rubbish thrown to the side it all looks the same colour and all of the rubbish doesn't look like anything that used to be a thing it's all dusty dirty faded white yellow blue grey everything here has been faded by the sun and I'm a bit hot but I don’t know why I've gotta I've got the temperature turned down quite cool but I feel quite sweaty I'm when I get to a services I'll take my jumper off I think I guess I could describe the car a bit um inside of my car is very dirty there's a lot of rubbish that's fallen down the left side the left seat and slid out under beneath it and gone into the back um there are two water bottles down by my feet one of them is half they’re both half full one of them is really old and it's got mud all over the bottom bit of it um I have my air conditioning turned down all the way to cold but not on very strong so that hopefully my phone is still picking up my voice there's a pack of tissues that’s oh fair play to me that’s quite a good idea I have my iPod in my cup holder *cough* and beneath it is a receipt and a really melted kitkat there's little specks of Pringles and mud and dirt my phone is on the left seat next to my glasses case and my wallet on my right knee because my car is quite small my key dangles onto my right knee it’s got a LEGO man dressed in a hotdog costume and an Animal Crossing character and I’m playing with it a little bit with my knee like knocking it back and forth um I have plugged into the cigarette lighter a little cactus thing that splits it into multiple USB ports and im charging my phone and my phone is plugged no it’s not plugged in the I have an a white aux cord that's just hanging down into the pit in the in the compartment inside door to my right I have my house keys I have my keys for my flat in plymouth both of them have on them have keys that I don’t know where they're from where I've found them on the floor even dating back a few years um because I always feels like a missing key is like is weird and scary and I wouldn't want one of my keys if I lost it to just be hanging around on the floor I would want someone to have it because they’ll never know what it unlocks but maybe one day they will find what it unlocks and that’ll be an amazing occasion for them the trees on both sides of the road now are getting much thicker like dense forest and I'm looking into them and the layers of depth and the planes are really distinct and um you get wow I think there was like a little tent just set up in that forest there I think someone was maybe camping I don’t know I'm reminded of the final shot in Andrei Tarkovsky’s Mirror which I watched um like a few days ago where the parallaxing trees block out the movement of the grandma and her kids um it was like um nature blocking out memory or something I don’t know there's lots of leafless sticks and logs and stuff on the side bank there and the car behind me is getting a bit antsy I think they’re going a lot faster than me and they’re frustrated they can't overtake they’re coming round the side now there was a very neat man-made looking river just there river bend meander and the lorry I'm just passing is a really beautiful shade of purple um faded muddy purple with a cleaner cab um cleaner white cab *cough* there's a lot more rubbish down the side now and those little plastic tubes that grow baby trees in saplings I guess is the technical term baby tree um I'm thinking more and more that the background noise is gonna make it impossible for the dictation software to do this for me and I'll have to do it myself and that is really intimidating and scary to me but I guess it’ll only take well it’ll take I would say double the time this journey takes so multiple sittings 12 hours at oh my god fucking hell I guess I don’t know do we have less stuff at college now I think we might do I don’t think we have life drawing on Tuesday anymore so ok there are signs just there’s a sign here saying for The Oracle leave at junction 11 and The Oracle is capitalised what the fuck is The Oracle why does that feel like some kind of fantasy sign and I'm like on a quest where it’s like to y’know you’re looking for The Oracle go this way I think im coming into a road work section yeah im having to slow down oh that'll be nice for the recording um it'll mean that it’s easier to hear there's not as much road noise I really really want a coffee the car colours of the cars around me now are more greys there's a darker grey there's a grey black a silver two more blacks a dark grey further ahead a white van a white lorry behind me a red and white lorry a white lorry with a red symbol two more black cars one of them looks more like a bus a minibus another white lorry behind a blue van a red fancy looking shiny ass new red car a bird just flew overhead to the right there's a blue lorry one of those car containing pickup ones more blacks greys whites greys orange cones and green and light brown and more white blossom that looks like it’s falling more worn concrete a giant bridge with moss up the side that I just passed underneath more sandbags holding down rusting signs more emergency phones standing out with their fluorescent highlighter orange even brighter than the cones which are still muddy um as always there's some new brighter orange fences warning fences maybe these lamp posts are new there’s yellow wires coming out of them they must be new   they must have just been repaired or something I'm still having to go 50 and there's a sign with a deer on it but there doesn’t seem to actually be any roadworks or any change in the road shape so I guess I do remember driving through that so they must have finished that section now I'm thinking that I might I've got two ideas with what to do with this text or a few I guess I could either turn it into a long video piece and show that at the final show or turn it into a book which I think I would like to do as well as the video piece if I do the video and I can either print it normally as you would print a novel structure it like a Mark Danielewski book with concrete poetry kind of references in the way the text is laid out and that could be interesting but would also take absolutely fucking forever but I need to look up how much time I've got left oh man the fences on the side now are wooden and old and now they look concrete they look like concrete wood and they've got ivy and sticks growing out of them and there's discarded fences horizontal and un and illegible and yellow post that has security cameras on it and now the temporary road arrangement is coming into act there’s cats eyes splitting the road and moving it into narrower lanes so I have to be more careful now with my driving um I should be ok but a van on the left is coming up quite aggressively looking like it wants to go faster but that is just fucking stupid man slow down the fields on the left have have got tufty grass kind of reminds me of um when I was in Wales for that geography coursework and there’s yellow wires hanging between the trees and I think it’s little things like this that I don’t never notice and they’re the things that make areas believable um you can always hang a fucking wire between things and it’ll make it look more realistic I feel like *cough* car just overtook me on the right my throat is getting quite rough from all this talking I really do need a coffee I hope that and I've gone down another tick on the I've gone down another tick on my petrol I'm almost in the red zone now so I really do need a service station soon um I still don't know where a sign was I think the sign said it was at coming towards the twenty miles away sorry I feel like my thoughts are faster than my speech but I don't know how they can be because I'm trying to just speak what I'm thinking but at the same time I'm thinking about what I'm gonna say before I say it and it’s difficult and strange and almost out of body and I don't know what to d ah and there’s the cars behind me I'm the only car in the middle lane it seems um keeping a steady pace behind this lorry thats on the left I don't think I have enough room to overtake it um my lane is being very narrow now and now they're coming back into their full size lanes and I'm hoping that I'll go back up to normal speed soon there's a little brick cartoon looking house on the right that must be a place where they watch the cameras I don't know and like a Bentley or something is really coming up close behind me um but I'm I am going over the speed limit so I don't know what it wants me to do um ok we’re going up to full speed again now still on the M4 road coming up on the left is going to the A33 um ah there’s a little modern VW beetle there with a a smiling woman um and a big glass window out the back that new design and some of these cones on the left now are blue a electric blue and I've not seen those before no ah no I'm lying I have seen those before there was some very detailed colourful graffiti there but I don't know what those cones are for are they for I don't know maybe they're just a new colour of cone that they're slowly introducing as a replacement but I don't know I'm feeling like I might be coming up I'm coming up to Reading now there must be services at Reading um I I pray I pray I really want a coffee and a rest from speaking at least momentarily cars really going fast on my right here so scary I really like the way the wind turbines look on the horizon I like how in in contemporary Japanese illustration and Japanese art direction there's always wind turbines and they use them as a beautiful symbol but then over here we have all these bullshit ass conservative old people complaining about how they ruin the landscape which is just not true but then in like I'm thinking about Big Hero 6 or like the old Tamagotchi website that’s a deep cut having wind turbines um in a beautiful way I think that’s really nice there's a big Pepsico building coming up on the left no on the right sorry and it looks very old the logo is old and it’s weird to me that Pepsico is the name of that company because it’s j I mean it’s very on the nose isn’t it  I mean did they come up with Pepsi first and then name the company after Pepsi maybe I don't know there’s a um what the fuck there’s a lake with a giant inflatable obstacle course orange and white obstacle course floating in the lake there underneath the pylons and the wires and the van that I'm just passing has humanoid chefs with duck heads I feel like this drive is taking a surreal turn but I'm not even it’s just I'm just noticing things and now there’s a solar farm on the left the solar panels are facing away so I'm just seeing the back of them um reminds me of tree bark the kind of texture and lines that they’re creating I think that’s really nice um I'm coming off now onto reading services there’s a big tower big mound of dirt with grass and weeds growing out of it and there’s some horses to the left in a field lots of horses actually brown horses mostly there’s some a couple of white horses um white horse with a black head lots of horses and there and lots of mounds of dirt and what looked like conveyor belts that you see at like mines like coal mines I wonder what they're digging for they must be digging for something um there’s stacks of tires there’s I can see blue patches of sky now I'm slowing right down now coming into these services I think they’re ones I'm somewhat familiar with I'm recognising the signs there’s a big cement mixer truck coming out now I think I'm gonna get petrol first and then go in for no no I'll get a coffee first and then go in for petrol yeah this is the one I normally stop at I'm on good making good time then I guess in a way it’s not that difficult there’s some big boulders here decorative haha boulders I wonder if they must be real but where did they get them from why would they ship in like buy boulders in order to decorate this service station and oh services stations are so weird they feel like theme parks there’s all these signs directing you around like I'm like I'm pulling into Centre Parcs and parking and pulling up and there's a there's a Holiday Inn here and it’s like who is I just had my hair cut before I took this drive and I was talking to the barber about how weird it was that oh shit I've  gone the wrong way I've  gone the wrong way I wasn’t paying attention I'll have to go in a big circle round I guess it gives me more time to talk about it um I was talking to my barber about how weird it was that there are Holiday Inns and things at service stations and that means there must be people staying um but how many people are service station hotel at night um that’s just a weird thought to me um ok I'm at a petrol station I have to pass through it oh I bet I look so shifty talking to myself like this I'm just letting a lorry go in front I remember stopping here with {…} no with {…} when my wiper fluid reservoir was leaking what is this truck doing that I'm following behind I wish it hadn't pulled out would've been fine so I can go I can go right here yeah into the main service station and I'm gonna pay closer attention this time so that doesn't happen again so when I when I stop here I'm gonna stop the recording and I'm not gonna talk until I get back in and then I'll maybe talk about what happened inside um I really really hope it’s recorded this all um there’s so many signs everywhere with such small text and they're right at the side of a road that you're not gonna stop on and that’s really bizarre like where what how would anyone read them I guess it’s some of those like terms and conditions signs that are designed not to be read really but like they exist so the people can say that they did do it I remember stopping at this station with {…} when we were on our way to the King of Limbs that one time ok I'm I'm pulling up now and I'm about to stop the recording for the first time
